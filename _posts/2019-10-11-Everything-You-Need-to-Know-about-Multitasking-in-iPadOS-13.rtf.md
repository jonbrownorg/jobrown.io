With this year's operating system updates, Apple has formally
acknowledged that the iPhone and iPad have different uses and different
needs. To that end, Apple has given the iPad version of iOS 13 its own
name---iPadOS 13.

The big changes include a desktop-class version of Safari that works
better with complex Web apps, a redesigned Home screen that sports more
icons and Today View widgets, a new floating keyboard you can use for
thumb-typing or with one hand, Apple Pencil improvements, and the
Sidecar feature that lets you use an iPad as a Mac's second screen or
graphics tablet.

Also important are the tweaks Apple made to iPadOS's multitasking
capabilities. Particularly when you pair an iPad with a Smart Keyboard,
you can now get real work done on an iPad more fluidly than ever before.
The "hard" part is learning how you switch between apps, display a
second app in a Slide Over panel that floats on top of another app, or
make two apps share the screen in Split View. Here's what you can do.​

**Switch Between Apps**

Moving between apps is a key aspect of using the iPad. Apple has
provided multiple ways to switch so you can pick those that best fit
your style:

-   Press the Home button, and on the Home screen,
    tap another app's icon.

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2019/20191002Ev/iPadOS-multitasking-App-Switcher.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="800" />

-   Swipe down on the Home screen to show Siri app
    suggestions and search for any app.
-   Within an app, swipe left or right with four
    fingers to switch to the previous or next app.
-   Within an app, swipe up from below the bottom
    of the screen to reveal the Dock, and then tap an icon on it. The
    three rightmost icons are your most recently used apps.
-   After revealing the Dock, keep swiping up to
    reveal the app-switching screen, then tap an app thumbnail to switch
    to it. Swipe right to see less recently used apps.
-   On a physical keyboard, press Command-Tab to
    bring up a Mac-like app switcher. Release both keys quickly to
    switch to the previous app instantly, or keep Command down while you
    press Tab repeatedly to move sequentially among the shown apps,
    letting up on Command to switch. While the app switcher is shown,
    you can also tap an icon in it.​

**Display an App in Slide Over**

Say you're working on your iPad, perhaps in Safari, and you want to keep
an eye on your favorite weather app (we like [Dark
Sky](https://darksky.net/app)) because an upcoming storm might
affect your upcoming bike ride. You don't need to see both apps all the
time, but you also don't want to have to switch back and forth. With
Slide Over, you can put Dark Sky in a panel that floats over Safari and
then hide and show it.

The easiest way to put an app in a Slide Over panel is to use the Dock,
so this technique works best if the app's icon is already on the Dock.
For instance, while you're in Safari, swipe up from the bottom of the
screen to display the Dock. Then touch and hold the Dark Sky app's icon
until it dims slightly. Keeping your finger down, drag the icon over
Safari until it becomes a vertical lozenge.

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2019/20191002Ev/iPadOS-multitasking-Slide-Over-switcher.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="800" />

Lift your finger, and Dark Sky appears in Slide Over. (If you get a
horizontal rectangle instead of a vertical lozenge, the app won't work
in Slide Over because it needs a larger
window.)

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2019/20191002Ev/iPadOS-multitasking-Slide-Over.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="800" />

If the app you want to put in Slide Over isn't on your Dock, you can use
a two-handed procedure to get it from another location and drop it onto
another app. Working on the Home screen or the Siri search screen, start
dragging an app icon (it's OK if the icons start wiggling). Then use
your other hand to switch to the other app (perhaps by swiping right
with four fingers or pressing Command-Tab on a physical keyboard) and
drop it over the other app. Don't worry if you have trouble at
first---it takes time to become accustomed to two-handed usage.

Once an app is in Slide Over on the right side of the screen, you can
swipe right on its left edge or the gray bar at the top to hide it, or
swipe left on its right edge or gray bar to move it to the other side of
the screen. If Slide Over is hidden, swipe left from the right edge of
the screen to display it.

If you think Slide Over looks a bit like an iPhone app on your iPad
screen, iPadOS 13's big enhancement will make sense. You can now open
multiple apps in Slide Over---just drag a new app over the main app as
you would normally. Once you have two or more apps in Slide Over, you
can cycle through them by swiping right or left on the thick black bar
at the bottom, just like on a Face ID-equipped iPhone. To see what
you've got in Slide Over, swipe up slightly on that thick black bar to
display a Slide Over app switcher; tap any thumbnail to switch to it.

**Open Multiple Apps in Split View**

Imagine that you want to email someone a photo you took, so you want
Mail and Photos showing at the same time. Displaying two apps
side-by-side in Split View is nearly the same action as Slide Over. The
difference is that, instead of dropping the app lozenge on top of the
current app, you drag it to the far left or right of the screen, and
drop it once the screen shows a 90/10 split---after you drop, the split
changes to 50/50.

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2019/20191002Ev/iPadOS-multitasking-Split-View.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="800" />


Drag the handle between the apps to switch to a 70/30 or 30/70 split; if
you drag the handle all the way to one side of the screen, the app
that's shrinking in size disappears entirely. Both apps in Split View
have a handle at the top as well, and dragging one of those down
slightly converts that app into a Slide Over
panel.

Bonus tip: If you've become comfortable with Split View, note that you
can also grab an app by that handle and drop it to the left or right of
another app---switch apps with your other hand---to move it to another
Split View space. (You can also drag a Slide Over app's handle down
slightly to switch it to Split View.)

New in iPadOS is the capability to open multiple windows from the same
app. Not all apps support this (or Split View at all), but Safari and
Notes are good examples of apps that do. To do this, while in the app,
bring up the Dock, tap the app's icon, and then tap the + button in the
upper-right corner of the screen.

There are more direct ways of opening multiple windows from the same app
too. In Safari, tap and hold the Tabs icon (two stacked squares) and
then tap Open New Window to get a second Safari window. You can also
drag a tab from Safari's Tab bar to the side of the screen to open it in
Split View.

Similarly, you can drag notes from the sidebar in Notes to open them in
Split View, either as a second Notes window within the same space, or as
an addition to a new Split View space.

With all these possibilities, it's easy to get confused about what's
open where. The iPadOS app switcher now displays thumbnails of the Split
View spaces so you can switch among them
easily.

And if you aren't sure which space has a particular Safari window, for
instance, tap and hold the Safari icon in the Dock (or anywhere else)
and choose Show All Windows to see all the spaces---including Slide
Over---that include Safari windows (Apple calls this App Exposé).

Take a few minutes and try putting apps in Slide Over and Split View in
different ways, since some of the actions require practice before they
feel natural. Finally, if combining two particular apps doesn't seem to
work, don't fret. Apps must specifically support both Slide Over and
Split View, and not all do.

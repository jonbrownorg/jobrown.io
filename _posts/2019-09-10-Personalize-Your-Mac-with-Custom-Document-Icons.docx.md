Do you have a document that you open regularly, perhaps from your
Desktop? If you'd like to make it stand out from other documents, why
not give it a custom icon? This was common practice on the Mac back in
the day, and it's still possible in modern versions of macOS. Go to
[Google Images](https://images.google.com/){:rel="nofollow"} and search for
"*searchTerm* icon" to see what images are available. (It's fine to use
any graphic for one-time personal use; if you're planning to distribute
the file or publish the icon in any way, make sure to read and honor any
licensing requirements.) Download an image you like (Control-click it
and look for a Save Image command), open it in Preview (where you can
delete any background or crop as desired), press Command-A for Select
All, and Command-C to copy the image. Then select the icon for the file
you want to customize, press Command-I to open its Get Info window,
click the current icon in the upper-left corner (it gets a faint
highlight outline), and press Command-V to paste.

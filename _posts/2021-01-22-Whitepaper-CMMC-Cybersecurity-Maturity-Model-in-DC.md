### What is the CMMC (Cybersecurity Maturity Model), and what does it mean for you?

The Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) is the Department of Defenseâ€™s (DoD) latest cybersecurity program designed to ensure that cybersecurity controls and processes adequately protect Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) that resides on Defense Industrial Base (DIB) systems and networks.  The DIB consists of all suppliers of DOD related services including primes/subs/consultants that provide any type of service on a DOD related contract.

The DoD implemented requirements for safeguarding CUI information and cyber incidents through the release of Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) 252.204-7012 in October 2016.  The DFARS directed DoD Contractors to self-attest that adequate security controls were implemented within contractor systems to ensure that CDI confidentiality was maintained.

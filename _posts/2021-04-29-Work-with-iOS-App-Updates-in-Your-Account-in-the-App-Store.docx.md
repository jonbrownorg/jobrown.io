If you've turned on automatic App Updates in Settings > App Store on
your iPhone or iPad, you might wonder how you'd know if an app was
updated or what changed. To find that information, open the App Store
app and tap your avatar icon in the upper-right corner. Scroll down and
you'll see an Updated Recently list. If you pull down on the screen,
that will force it to refresh, and you may see a list called Upcoming
Automatic Updates at the top. For any downloaded update, you can tap
Open to open it. If it hasn't yet been downloaded, you can tap Update to
update it right away rather than waiting for the automatic update. Tap
More to see the full release notes. Finally, here's a hidden tip: swipe
left on any app to delete it.

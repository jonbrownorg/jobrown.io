Imaginatively called Apple One, you can now pay for a single
subscription which will provide access to the following Apple
subscription services:

Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade & iCloud

There will also be a Premier version of Apple One which will provide the
additional extra services of; Apple News+ & Apple Fitness+.

The Apple One service should launch in October 2020, on the official
Apple website Books, iTunes, & Apple Card are not listed as one of the
services that will be made part of the Apple One subscription, however
these services provide one off purchases rather than a subscription
model.

It looks like the family edition will provide the biggest discount as it
will allow 5 people all to use the same subscription, having said that
the family edition will only provide 200GB of iCloud storage and if this
is shared between 5 people you may need to pay for additional storage
space.

If like me you recently purchased the tv+ service to watch Ted Lasso and
the Tom Hanks film Greyhound and you are also paying for additional
iCloud storage and share this with family, the Apple One family
subscription is a no brainer.

If Apple were to offer the "Apple One" subscription free for all new
Mac, iPhone, & iPad purchases that would put a country mile between
Android & iOS/Mac systems, making the choice between the two easy to
make for new customers.

Personally I'm looking forward to saving $8 a month using the family
subscription and I hope between now and the launch date, Apple adds some
new subscriptions services to Apple One, maybe Apple Books with a book
of the month free to read.

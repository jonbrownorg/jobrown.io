First, don't panic. Most likely, you're borrowing something with an
Apple [AirTag](https://www.apple.com/airtag/) location tracker attached
to it, or someone left something with an attached AirTag in your car.
Second, tap the alert to open the Find My app, which displays a map
showing where the AirTag has been with you, which might shed some light
on where it started traveling with you. Third, in the Find My app, tap
Play Sound to try to locate the AirTag by its audible alert. Fourth, if
you find the AirTag, hold it near your iPhone until a notification
appears, and tap that for more information, including the last four
digits of the owner's phone number (search for it in the Contacts app to
see if it's anyone you know). We're being intentionally brief here---for
significantly more detail, including advice on contacting local law
enforcement---read [Apple's support
article](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212227).

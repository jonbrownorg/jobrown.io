It seems simple enough, but there are some great features, built in
apps, and third party apps that can really improve your workflow when
copy and pasting.

The very basics are on a Mac are; highlight the content you want to copy
and press <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>.

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20200526Ho/image1.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />

Then where you want to paste the content you have just copied place the
cursor and press <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd>.

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20200526Ho/image2.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />

You can also copy & paste using the contextual menu, which is accessed
using a right click or holding the <kbd>CTRL</kbd> Key and left clicking (or hold
<kbd>CTRL</kbd> key and tap on the track pad).

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20200526Ho/image3.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="400" />

Do the same again right click or hold <kbd>CTRL</kbd> and left click where you want
the content and chose paste:

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20200526Ho/image4.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="400" />

These commands are also available in the Edit Menu in almost all Apps on
the Mac.

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20200526Ho/image5.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="400" />

You can use the same shortcuts and context menus to copy and paste most
things to and from most locations this includes files & folders.

Most of you will be thinking great but I already know how to do that,
well read on as built into MacOs are some really handy time savers when
it comes to copy & paste.

If you've forgotten what you have just copied or even cut look in the
Finder Edit menu and you will find "Show Clipboard":

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20200526Ho/image6.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="400" />

If you don't want to paste the style & formatting of text from one
document to another.

(in this example from safari to a word doc.)

When copying some text in Safari for example and paste it straight into
word using <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd> it also carries the styling of the text like so:

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20200526Ho/image7.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="200" />

If we press <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>Option</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd> it will just paste the text
preserving the style and formatting of the current document:

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20200526Ho/image8.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="200" />

This is great if you want to provide a citation for example.

In some Apple Apps such as Pages & Numbers if you specifically want to
copy the style & formatting from the original document press
<kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>Option</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> and then paste with <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>Option</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd>.

This will not copy any text characters but will instead just copy the
formatting of the text leaving you start typing in your own text in the
same style of the text you copied.

## Copy and paste between devices

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20200526Ho/image9.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />

In MacOs If you own one of these devices you can easily copy and paste
between them it's called the "Universal Clipboard":

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20200526Ho/image10.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />

To make sure Universal Clipboard is enabled on your Mac go to System
Preferences \> General \> and select "Allow Handoff between this Mac and
your iCloud devices".

On your iPhone, iPad etc... Go to Settings \> General \> Handoff, and
turn on Handoff.

These devices will all have to be signed into the same iCloud device for
this to work!

## Grab

Grab is the built in App for taking screenshots. You'll find Grab
already installed in Applications \> Utilities.

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20200526Ho/image11.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />

Some of Grabs commands are accessible with the following Keyboard
commands (shortcuts) all of these screenshots will be saved to your
desktop:

**Screenshot of a specific area:**

Use <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>4</kbd>

**Screenshot of the entire screen:**

Use <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>3</kbd>

**Screenshot of a certain window:**

Use <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>4</kbd>, then <kbd>Space bar</kbd>

**Screenshot of your MacBook's Touch Bar:**

Use <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>6</kbd>

If you don't want your screenshots saved to the Desktop, open the Grab
app and each screenshot will become a new window in grab from where you
can save or copy/paste them.

You can see the options available in Grab by opening the App and looking
at the help menu and choose "Grab Help".

## Skitch

There are other snipping, clipping and screenshot tools available,
search the App Store, however this free app is great, it has mark up
features built in.

It's available in the App store for iOS and MacOS search for Skitch.

Open Skitch after you have installed it and choose the kind of
screenshot you want to take:

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20200526Ho/image15.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />

Then you can add mark-up using the tool bar on the left hand side.

See our excellent article [here](https://grovetech.co/blog/copy-and-paste/) to get started with Skitch.

This week we talked about the fact over 50% of iDevice users have updated their devices to iOS 11.

Well this Tuesday the 31/10/2017 Apple has released iOS 11.1 which fixes a security concern know as a KRACK attack.

The KRACK attack is a hack on wireless networks allowing hackers to decrypt Wi-Fi traffic which means the hacker can: eavesdrop on communications, perform man-in-the-middle attacks, hijack connections, and more.

This is not a fault specifically with iDevices or one caused by Apple but an industry wide security flaw with any device that uses WPA2 passwords on a WIFI connection.

However this is a sophisticated attack and it is not likely to affect many people.
If your iDevice has iOS 11, the download for iOS 11.1 is in: Settings > General > Software Update.

iOS 11.1 is available for iPhone 5s users and later, iPad Pros, iPad Air & later, iPad mini 2 & later.

As well as the major security flaw with WPA2, iOS 11.1 addresses other issues across iDevices which have a 3D Touch display mainly the use of the Application Switcher.

iOS 11.1 also includes 70 new emoji and other fixes and improvements.

Carry out this update or schedule it ASAP the next time you are on WIFI.

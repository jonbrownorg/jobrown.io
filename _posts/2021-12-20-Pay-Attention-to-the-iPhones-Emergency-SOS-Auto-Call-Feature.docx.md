Did you know that pressing and holding the side button and one of the
volume buttons on an iPhone 8 or later brings up a screen that lets you
power your iPhone off, show your medical ID, and invoke Emergency SOS?
(On earlier iPhones, press the side or top button five times.) Slide
Emergency SOS, and your iPhone will immediately call emergency services,
which could be lifesaving in a real emergency. Even without touching​​
that slider, if you continue to hold the side button and volume button,
after a 5-second countdown, the iPhone automatically calls emergency
services, which may not be what you want. At least in the US, even if
you hang up, that will likely cause the 911 dispatcher to send police to
your location. To ensure that you can't accidentally trigger Emergency
SOS to call automatically, go to Settings > Emergency SOS and turn off
Auto Call. We won't say how we know this can happen.

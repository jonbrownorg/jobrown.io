Are you overwhelmed by email? Is your Inbox filled with promotions,
special offers, and the like? These messages aren't spam---you almost
always bought something from the company or have some sort of
relationship with the sender---but that doesn't mean you want to hear
from them repeatedly. Luckily, it's easy to get off the lists of
legitimate senders. Just scroll to the bottom of each message and look
for an unsubscribe link. Often it will be the word "Unsubscribe" or an
instruction to "click here to remove yourself." Click the link and, if
necessary, click an Unsubscribe button on the resulting Web page. Then
delete the message and move on to the next one. After a week or so of
doing this regularly, you should start to notice a marked decrease in
unwanted messages.

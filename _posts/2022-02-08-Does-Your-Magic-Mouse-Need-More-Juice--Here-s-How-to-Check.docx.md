It's unfortunate that the most recent iteration of the Magic Mouse has
its Lightning charging port on the bottom, making it impossible to use
while charging, unlike the Magic Keyboard and Magic Trackpad, which work
fine when plugged in. To check if your Magic Mouse needs charging before
it starts to nag (and starts acting a little funky), look in one of
these spots. If your menu bar is displaying the Bluetooth icon, click
it, and the charge level should show up. Or click the Control Center
icon on the menu bar and click Bluetooth. You can also look in System
Preferences, in either the Bluetooth preference pane or the Mouse
preference pane. In our experience, the Bluetooth menu is the easiest,
but Control Center and the Mouse preference pane are the most
reliable---sometimes the charge level doesn't appear in the menu.

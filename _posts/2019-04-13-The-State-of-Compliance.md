We are all aware of federal compliance regulations when it comes to the
privacy and security of our information.  For example, you'd be hard
pressed to find someone who hasn't heard of HIPAA.  Yet are you aware
that regulations have been put in place at the state level that have the
same goal -- to protect our security and privacy?

This month (March 2019), the state of New York reached the end date for
the Cybersecurity Regulation of the New York Department of Financial
Services (NYDFS) regulations.  These required third-party service
providers to meet certain requirements that address their data security
and compliance.  A two-year time frame was provided to allow those
banking, insurance, and other institutions that fell under the Covered
Entities title to reach that compliance measure. The window to meet the
Cybersecurity Regulation of the New York Department of Financial
Services (NYDFS) was established with a generous frame due to the
complexity of the process, so anyone not meeting that deadline will be a
target for enforcement.

Written policies and procedures take time and finding qualified people
to first learn your business and establish your compliance is not
something you can take on lightly.  The NYDFS required identification,
risk assessment, establishing minimum cybersecurity practices that
include encryption, controlled access, contractual protection, and
finally due diligence processes to evaluate cybersecurity practices of
third-party vendors.

As of today, 50 states have varying legislatures enacted that outline
data breach notification laws.  Do you know what your legal requirements
are if you are hacked? What if you work with clientele across state
lines?  All very important questions.  It is always wise to go with the
guideline that is more stringent.  When it comes to cybersecurity and
privacy there is no limit to how strong your line of defense should be.

Having a plan in place to prevent and remediate damage is key, but you
also need to ensure that you are covering all of the legalities in your
process.

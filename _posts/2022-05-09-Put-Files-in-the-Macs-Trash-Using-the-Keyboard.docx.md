You know that you can drag files or folders to the Trash icon in the
Dock for later deletion. And you probably know that you can select
multiple items on the Desktop or in a Finder window by Command-clicking
each one in turn (Shift-click to select a sequential range of items in a
list view), after which you can drag them all to the Trash. But there's
no reason to expend effort mousing if you prefer to keep your hands on
the keyboard---just press Command-Delete to send one or more selected
files and folders directly to the Trash. Finally, if you need your disk
space back right away, press Command-Shift-Delete to empty the Trash.
However, we recommend not emptying the Trash frequently---that way, you
have a chance to recover something you discover that you needed after
trashing it.

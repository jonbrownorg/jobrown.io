Some of us like to customise the look and feel of our Home Screens
whether it is to match our branding or just to give a different look and
feel.

You'll need to add a photo or image to your Photos or Files on the
iPhone/iPad for each App you want to make a custom icon for. Icon packs
are also being made available for iOS 14 via many online retail sites,
just search for iOS14 icon packs!

Now open the Shortcuts App, it is pre-installed on iOS devices, if the
icon isn't on your home screen you can always search for it:

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20201001Cu/image9.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="400" />

From within Shortcuts tap on "All Shortcuts"

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20201001Cu/image5.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="400" />


Now tap the + symbol top right corner.

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20201001Cu/image12.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="400" />


On the "New Shortcut" screen tap Add Action.

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20201001Cu/image9.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="400" />


Search "Open App" or scroll through the options until you find the
action "Open App".

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20201001Cu/image4.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="400" />


After tapping "Open App", the screen changes to "Open Choose", Tap
choose and choose the App you want to open.

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20201001Cu/image13.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="400" />


I'm adding a custom icon to my Calendar App.

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20201001Cu/image14.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="400" />


Next tap the three dots in a row to set the options.

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20201001Cu/image3.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="400" />


Set the name in my case it is the Calendar

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20201001Cu/image10.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="400" />


Next tap "Add to Home Screen"

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20201001Cu/image6.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="400" />


Now you will be given the option to choose the custom icon you have
already saved to your photos or files!

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20201001Cu/image8.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="400" />


<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20201001Cu/image7.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="400" />


Next tap "Add"

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20201001Cu/image2.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="400" />


And there we have it a customised icon for my Calendar App, simply
repeat these steps for all the Apps you would like to change the icon
for.

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20201001Cu/image11.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="400" />

It's nice to see Apple adding more customization options, while it is
not for everyone some people really enjoy making their devices look
exactly how they want them to look, not as they come from the
factory.

Whereas previously it was difficult to customize your iPhone in this
way, making it easy to do for the end user is a step in the right
direction for Apple and iOS devices.

Some people find it hard to find the mouse pointer at times,
particularly on a large screen or when working in Dark Mode or in apps
with dark interfaces. You've long been able to increase the size of the
pointer generally and also zoom it temporarily by shaking it, but in
macOS 12 Monterey, Apple now lets you change the color of the pointer.
That could be a boon to those who have trouble seeing it otherwise. Go
to System Preferences \> Accessibility \> Display \> Pointer, click the
Pointer Fill Color box, and choose a different color in the color
picker. You can also choose a different Pointer Outline Color if that's
helpful. After customizing it, if you decide you prefer the old
black-and-white version, click the Reset button.

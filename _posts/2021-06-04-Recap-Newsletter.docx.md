**2020 Recap**

With 2020 fading into the distance, we wanted to take a moment to
reflect on the year. It was a challenging year for all of our clients
and for Grove. The pandemic brought a new level of uncertainty and fear
to the forefront of many of our clients' minds, and it seems appropriate
to address how Grove changed to ensure we provided the best possible
support for you.

Because of the stay-at-home mandates in most states we operate in, Grove
started working from our respective homes in January 2020, as did many
of our clients. Our business model pivoted from providing on-site
support to remote support that is tailored to the needs of our clients'
staff. This meant more remote meetings and less on-site appointments, as
well as the need for active management of home devices (home Wi-Fi
networks and more) to ensure that staff members could do their jobs.

During 2020, we became experts in remote management of computer systems,
network systems, data storage systems, backup systems, and more. Since
we relied on managing many of these issues in person, we quickly adapted
with new technologies and tools to accomplish the tasks needed to ensure
operational efficiency and security for our clients in a fully remote
setting.

Security became one of the most important concerns of our clients in
2020, and to respond we started offering a whole range of security
solutions ranging from policy and procedure writing to documentation and
dark web scanning and more.

We count ourselves fortunate to have partnered with such amazing clients
over the course of 2020. While it was a scary time, we grew, broadened
our service offerings, and met the needs and challenges of our clients.

Thank you for your continued support and partnership with us. If it
wasn't for your financial commitment, we might not be here today.

**Big Changes, New Team, and What That Means for You**

While 2020 was a tumultuous year for all, Grove and our team grew! On
that note, I am pleased to introduce three new hires that we made in
late 2020 and early 2021.

In February 2021, we welcomed [Mikaela
Donelan](mailto:mikaela@grovetech.co) to the team. Mikaela is
helping Grove establish both a project management and client success
department here at Grove and has hit the ground running by providing
top-notch project management services. While we have always been
detail-oriented, we're taking that to the next level. With a dedicated
project manager, we are able to achieve the level of organization and
transparency that our clients expect.

On top of being an amazing project manager, Mikaela is also our clients'
main touchpoint for any account/service issues, so she can ensure that
our clients are not only satisfied with the services we provide but are
actually getting the most out of their financial investment with Grove.

In March 2021, we hired [Nikki Lewis](mailto:nikki@grovetech.co), our newest Mac Expert. Nikki worked
with Apple directly for the past six years as a manager in the Applecare
department where she helped clients triage their issues related to MacOS
and iOS. Nikki is helping to provide support to our already amazing team
of Mac support experts, so we can provide that one-on-one personal
experience to each of our clients.

Finally in May 2021, we hired [Vince
Borho](mailto:vince@grovetech.co). Vince is a contractor that is
helping our clients with systems administration tasks and
engineering-level modifications. From sweeping changes to Office365 or
helping us tackle data migrations, Vince is helping our team ensure that
we have multiple qualified engineers on hand whenever our clients need
change either on the fly or as planned.

Please join me in welcoming our newest hires to the Grove team!

**Fully Distributed Company**

2020 not only taught us that we need to pivot with the needs of our
customers, but also that we do not need to physically interact with our
clients as often as we once had. Our business model has now changed to
reflect that and that has manifested itself in a few different ways.

Grove is now looking for the best talent nationwide. While we would love
to say that all of our staff live and work right here in the District,
the reality is that one of the hard lessons we learned in 2020 is that
there are amazing people working all over the country, and they are
transforming the way we do business. Not only are we more diverse
because of this shift, but we are also able to provide better services
and solutions.

Grove will continue to work in a fully distributed model. While we will
continue to operate in a co-working space in D.C., we will primarily
continue to operate from our respective homes, and we'll continue to
provide remote support first and on-site support second.

Grove will continue to offer on-site appointments with proper advance
notice. While we are a fully distributed company now, we do understand
that you will need help on-site at your location, especially as
restrictions ease. We will work hard to accommodate these needs.

Finally, now that we are growing, the goal for Jon, our CEO and founder,
is to transition slowly from Mac Expert to fully operating as CEO for
the business. Given our expansion, it's important to ensure that we
focus on the operations of our own company to ensure we meet the
expectations of our clients. This is the next natural step in our growth
plan as we transition out of our start-up phase.

What does this mean for you? For anyone who has been closely working
with Jon, nothing will change until December 2022. Between now and then,
Jon will slowly start handing off responsibilities to other members of
the team to ensure that our clients' needs are handled appropriately.

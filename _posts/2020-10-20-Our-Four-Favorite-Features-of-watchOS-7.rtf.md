The small screen of the Apple Watch prevents new watchOS features from
being as obvious or splashy as those in iOS and iPadOS. But [watchOS
7](https://www.apple.com/watchos/watchos-7/), now available for
the Apple Watch Series 3 and later when paired with an iPhone 6s or
later running iOS 14, has quite a few notable changes. Here are our
favorites: Family Setup, sleep tracking, handwashing reminders, and new
watch faces and complications.​

**Family Setup**

Since the original Apple Watch, Apple has required that every Apple
Watch be paired with an iPhone to simplify setup, reduce the reliance on
power-hungry Wi-Fi in favor of the more efficient Bluetooth, and more.
However, cellular-enabled Apple Watch models can do a lot without their
iPhone companion nearby. In watchOS 7, Apple has taken another step
toward a standalone Apple Watch, with [Family
Setup](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211768).

The goal behind Family Setup is to make it possible for children or
seniors to benefit from an Apple Watch without needing their own
iPhones. You pair their watches to your iPhone, but they get their own
phone numbers and use their own Apple ID on the watch. Family Setup
works only with cellular-capable Apple Watch Series 4 models or later,
and although a cellular plan isn't required, many features won't be
useful without one.

The most compelling benefits of Family Setup are that you can easily see
where the people wearing the watches are and communicate with them via
text messaging and phone calls. You can also control with whom they can
communicate and enforce a restricted
[Schooltime](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211782) mode that
helps kids stay focused. [Apple Cash
Family](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211324) lets you send
money to kids that they can spend via the contactless Apple Pay system.
Fall detection, high and low heart rate notifications, and Emergency SOS
might be welcome for seniors too.

Unfortunately, some desirable Apple Watch features aren't available
without a paired iPhone, so Family Setup members won't be able to take
advantage of irregular heart rhythm notifications, ECG, Cycle Tracking,
Sleep, Blood Oxygen, Podcasts, Remote, News, Home, and Shortcuts.​

**Sleep Tracking**

Sleep deprivation has been deemed a public health epidemic, with a third
of US adults reporting that they usually get less than the recommended
7--8 hours of sleep per night. Too little sleep causes losses of work
productivity and increases in motor vehicle accidents, and it's linked
to chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and
depression.

watchOS 7's new sleep tracking function helps you get on a healthy sleep
schedule, [tracks your
sleep](https://support.apple.com/guide/watch/sleep-apd830528336/watchos),
and shows you sleep trends in the Health app on the iPhone. You can most
easily set up the new Sleep mode in the Watch app on your iPhone (My
Watch > Sleep), and an option there lets you enable charging reminders,
since you can't charge it while you sleep with it on---while you get
ready for bed at night and while you're getting dressed in the morning
will be enough.

Flip over to the Sleep options in the Health app to create sleep
schedules---which can be different by the day---set sleep goals, and
configure a Wind Down period that enables Do Not Disturb and alerts you
when it's time to start winding down.

Of course, sleep tracking requires that you wear your Apple Watch in
bed, so Sleep mode simplifies the watch face and keeps it dark until you
tap it. Even then, it shows only the time at a very dim illumination
level. In the morning, the watch wishes you a good morning and shows you
the remaining battery life to remind you to charge it while getting
dressed.

To see your sleep data, in the Health app, tap Browse > Sleep (you can
tap a star under More to add it to your Favorites so it appears in the
Summary screen too). It reports how much time you spend asleep versus
just in bed, shows your average sleep times, and even records your heart
rate while you're sleeping.

Keep in mind that this data---however interesting---is useful only if
you can leverage it to improve your sleep. Remember, the goal is 7--8
hours of sleep on a regular schedule, so you're not messing with your
circadian rhythms too much. You might also consider third-party apps
that promise to apply machine learning to your data to recommend changes
in behavior---look for
[Sleep++](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sleep/id1038440371),
[SleepWatch](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sleep-watch-by-bodymatter/id1138066420),
[Sleep
Cycle](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sleep-cycle-sleep-tracker/id320606217),
and more.​

**Handwashing Reminders**

Although current research seems to be focusing on airborne transmission
of the coronavirus, those droplets and particles still fall on surfaces
that we touch, ensuring that handwashing remains important. watchOS 7
includes two features designed to help you remember to wash your hands
when necessary and to do so long enough that it helps.

In the Watch app, in My Watch > Handwashing, you can enable the
Handwashing Timer, which detects when you're washing your hands and
starts a 20-second timer. That's helpful, although the cooks among us
may find themselves ignoring it as they rinse their hands repeatedly
while preparing dinner. The Handwashing Reminders setting alerts you if
you haven't washed your hands shortly after returning home. Of course,
if you were just out for a bike ride or never got out of the car, those
notifications might be annoying.

**More Faces, More Complications, and Face Sharing**

The details here are way too varied to get into, but suffice it to say
that with watchOS 7, Apple has once again increased the number of watch
faces among which you can choose. New faces include Artistic,
Chronograph Pro, Count Up, GMT, Memoji, Stripes, and Typograph, all
shown below.

Many of these faces have slots for numerous complications, and with
watchOS 7, you can now add multiple complications from the same app if
you wish. If you spend a lot of time getting a watch face just right,
you can now share it with an Apple Watch-using friend by tapping the
Share button when customizing a face (press hard on the face of the
Apple Watch to enter customization mode).

Those are our favorite features, but they're by no means everything in
watchOS 7. Other features include support for four additional workout
types (Dance, Functional Strength Training, Core Training, and a
post-workout Cooldown), support for cycling directions in Maps,
translations in Siri, and improvements in hearing health. Once you've
upgraded, check them all out!

You likely know that you can use Do Not Disturb to prevent random
notifications on your iPhone from waking you at night---it's easy to set
a Do Not Disturb schedule for your usual sleeping hours. Another setting
in there is important but often overlooked. If you ever use your iPhone
during those Do Not Disturb hours---perhaps to read a book while a
partner or roommate is asleep---you don't want it to make any noise. To
prevent that, in Settings > Do Not Disturb, make sure to set Silence to
Always instead of While iPhone Is Locked.

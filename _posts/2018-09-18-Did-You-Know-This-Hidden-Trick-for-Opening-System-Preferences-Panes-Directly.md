## Did You Know This Hidden Trick for Opening System Preferences Panes Directly?
---

The System Preferences app on the Mac contains about 30 icons, each
leading to additional settings panes. Rather than opening System
Preferences, scanning the collection of icons, and clicking the one you
want, you can jump directly to the desired pane. Just click and hold on
the System Preferences icon in the Dock, and choose a pane from the
pop-up menu.

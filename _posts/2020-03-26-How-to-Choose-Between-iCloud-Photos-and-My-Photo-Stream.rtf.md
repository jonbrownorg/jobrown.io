For quite a few years, Apple enabled users to download their iPhone or
iPad photos to their Macs with a service called My Photo Stream. It
wasn't perfect, but it was free, and it did a decent job of ensuring
that photos you took on your iPhone or iPad would end up on your Mac.

Then Apple introduced iCloud Photo Library, later renamed to iCloud
Photos, which is a full-featured cloud-based photo syncing service.
However, because it stores all your photos in the cloud, most people
need to purchase more storage from Apple to use
it.

As a result, Apple has kept My Photo Stream around, at least for most
existing users. (The company says, "If you recently created your Apple
ID, My Photo Stream might not be available. If My Photo Stream isn't
available, use iCloud Photos to keep your photos and videos in iCloud."
Huh.) For those who have a choice, which should you use? (On the Mac,
you make that choice in Photos \> Preferences \> iCloud; in iOS, look in
Settings \> Photos.)

**Cost and Storage Details**

The key advantages of My Photo Stream over iCloud Photos are that My
Photo Stream is completely free and the storage it uses doesn't count
against your iCloud limits.

In contrast, Apple gives every iCloud user 5 GB of free storage, but
that's shared among all your iCloud services, like iCloud Drive and
icloud.com email, so it disappears quickly. Most of us have more than 5
GB of photos anyway. You can purchase 50 GB for \$0.99 per month, 200 GB
for \$2.99 per month, or 2 TB for \$9.99 per month ([prices vary
slightly in other
countries](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201238){:rel="nofollow"}).

On a pure price basis then, My Photo Stream wins. However, it suffers
from other limitations that make it less compelling:

-   My Photo Stream stores your photos on your iOS
    devices in a lower resolution to save space and transmission time.
    On the Mac, however, your photos download in full resolution. In
    contrast, iCloud Photos lets you choose on each device whether you
    want original images or optimized versions to save
    space---full-resolution originals are always stored in iCloud
    itself.
-   My Photo Stream manages only the last 30 days
    of photos and only the last 1000 photos. That's fine for just
    transferring photos from your iPhone to your Mac for permanent
    storage, but your other devices will be able to display only your
    most recent photos. iCloud Photos stores all your photos as long as
    you have sufficient space.
-   When you edit a photo while using My Photo
    Stream, the edits apply only to the photo you edited, not to
    versions synced with other devices. With iCloud Photos, all edits
    you make---on any of your devices---sync to all the rest of your
    devices.​

**Supported Formats**

There's another big gotcha with My Photo Stream. It supports only photos
and images in JPEG, PNG, and TIFF formats, plus most raw formats. That
doesn't sound terrible until you realize that it doesn't include Live
Photos or any video formats. That's right---My Photo Stream won't sync
your Live Photos or videos from your iPhone to your Mac at all! You'll
have to move them over manually in some other way.

In comparison, iCloud Photos supports the same still image formats as My
Photo Stream and adds GIF, HEIF, and more raw formats, along with Live
Photos. Plus, it supports MP4 and HEVC videos. In other words, iCloud
Photos will sync all your images and videos, regardless of format.​

**Supported Devices**

Finally, My Photo Stream works on the Mac, iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, and
Apple TV, and with Windows-based PCs. iCloud Photos extends that list to
include the Apple Watch and the iCloud.com Web site. Apple Watch support
likely isn't a dealbreaker for most people, but it can be useful to be
able to see all your photos in a Web browser on any computer.​

**Making the Choice**

Technically speaking, you can have both My Photo Stream and iCloud
Photos turned on. However, if you're using iCloud Photos, My Photo
Stream doesn't get you anything, so you should turn it off.

If you're trying to save money and have more than 5 GB of photos, My
Photo Stream works to bring most of your iPhone photos down to your Mac
for permanent storage in the Photos app. Just beware that it won't sync
your Live Photos or videos, and any other iOS devices you have will be
limited to seeing the last 30 days or 1000 photos.

For most people, though, iCloud Photos is the way to go. It's easily
worth \$12 or \$36 per year for 50 GB or 200 GB of storage, it syncs all
your photos and videos among all your devices, and it even syncs
edits.

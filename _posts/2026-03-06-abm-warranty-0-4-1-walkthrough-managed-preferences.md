In this part of the ABM Warranty 0.4.1 walkthrough series, I’m focusing on managed preferences and the credential packaging workflow. In the last video, I covered multiple credentials inside the app itself. In this one, I’m showing how to package those credentials so they can be deployed securely through MDM.

The goal here is not just to show that managed preferences exist. I want to show how the full workflow works: how I format the credential data, how the packaging script outputs the deployment files, how the credentials are encrypted, what the user sees when the app detects them, and how ABM Warranty behaves once those managed credentials are imported.

## What Managed Preferences Are Doing Here

Managed preferences are the way I can push ABM Warranty configuration down to a Mac through MDM instead of configuring everything manually on the endpoint. In this case, that means pushing managed credential data in a format the app can detect and import.

There are two practical output paths in this workflow:

- a mobileconfig file, which works with MDM platforms that can deploy configuration profiles
- a plist, which works where raw plist preference deployment is supported

That is what makes this feature flexible. I am not tied to only one management tool. If the MDM can push a mobileconfig, this workflow can fit. If the tool can deploy raw plist data, that works too.

## Why I Start With Security

Whenever I am building a deployment workflow that involves ABM or ASM credentials, I want the security model to be explicit. This part matters because no one should trust a credential deployment workflow unless it is clear how the secrets are being protected and what the receiving user is actually importing.

The starting point is still the CSV file. That file gives the packager the structured data it needs: the friendly name, the scope, the client ID, the key ID, and the path to the certificate or PEM file tied to each credential set. If I am packaging multiple credentials, each one gets its own row so the output can preserve those boundaries cleanly.

What matters is what happens next. The packager does not simply take that CSV data and write it back out in an MDM-friendly format. It prompts for a passphrase, derives the encryption material from that passphrase, and then protects the credential payload before writing it out.

At a high level, the private-key material is encrypted with AES-256-GCM. The encryption key is derived from the passphrase using HKDF with SHA-256. That matters because I want the output tied to a strong symmetric encryption model, and I want the key derivation to be based on a deliberate passphrase workflow instead of storing reusable key material in the deployment file itself.

Just as important, the passphrase is not stored in the plist or the mobileconfig output. The managed-preferences payload contains protected credential data, but it does not contain the passphrase needed to unlock that data. That means the deployment artifact alone is not enough to silently expose the underlying credential material.

On the receiving Mac, ABM Warranty does not import those credentials automatically behind the user’s back. The app requires explicit user consent to begin the import, and the user still has to provide the passphrase that was used when the payload was created. Only then can the app decrypt the protected credential data and complete the import.

I also built the managed import flow to behave like a one-time import by credential ID. That matters because I do not want the app repeatedly prompting the user to re-import the same managed credentials over and over again every time the preferences are detected. Treating the managed credential as a one-time import by ID prevents noisy re-import loops and keeps the workflow predictable.

Once the credentials are imported, the app can continue treating them as managed credentials in the interface, while the underlying credential lifecycle still stays bounded by the import model and the local security controls. That includes the app’s use of the keychain where appropriate for local handling after import.

That is the real point of the packager from a trust perspective. I can prepare deployable managed credentials without reducing the process to copying plain-text secrets into an MDM payload, and the receiving user still has to explicitly participate in the import before those credentials become active in the app.

## The Tools Behind the Workflow

This managed-preferences flow depends on the ABM Warranty managed credential packager and the supporting documentation that explains how to use it.

### Resources and sources

- [ABM Warranty Utilities](https://github.com/jonbrown21/ABM-Warranty-Utilities)
- [How to Use the ABM Credential Packager](https://github.com/jonbrown21/ABM-Warranty-Utilities/wiki/How-to-Use-the-ABM-Credential-Packager)

If you are the person building these managed credentials, that is where you should start. The workflow depends on that packager and the documented CSV format.

## The CSV Format I Use

The script expects the CSV data in a specific format. Each row represents one credential set. If I only have one credential, the file contains one row. If I have multiple credentials, the file contains multiple rows.

The important thing is that the columns stay in the expected order:

- a row identifier
- a friendly name
- a scope (`business` or `school`)
- the client ID
- the key ID
- the path to the certificate or PEM file

That structure is what lets the script package the data correctly. If the CSV is malformed, the managed-preferences output is not going to be right either.

## What I Need Before I Run the Script

Before I run the packager, I need a working Python 3 environment and the required cryptography package installed. That is part of the packaging side of the workflow, not the endpoint side.

The setup looks like this:

```bash
pip install cryptography
```

Once that is in place, I can run the script with a CSV input and choose whether I want plist output or mobileconfig output.

## How to Deploy A Single Credential

The script takes the CSV as input and then writes the managed-preferences output in the format I choose. If I am exporting a plist, I point the script to the CSV, define the output type, and provide a name for the output file.

A typical example looks like this:

```bash
python3 ABMManagedCredentialPackager.py --csv single.csv --out plist --name singleplist.plist
```

When I run that, the script prompts me for a passphrase. That passphrase is part of the encryption process. The script uses it to protect the credential data in the generated output.

That means the administrator packaging the credentials is not just generating a file. They are also defining the passphrase that the receiving user will need later when ABM Warranty imports and decrypts the managed credentials.

## What the Packager Outputs

Once the script runs, I get the encrypted output file along with a test command I can use locally. That is useful because I do not have to push the preferences through MDM immediately just to see whether they work.

I can test the managed preference on my own Mac first, apply the generated plist locally, quit the app, relaunch it, and verify the exact user experience before I ever deploy the payload more broadly.

That makes the workflow much easier to validate. I can confirm the packager output is correct before I roll it into an MDM deployment.

## How to Deploy Multiple Credentials

The workflow also supports more than one managed credential in the same deployment. If I build a CSV file with multiple rows, the output can contain multiple credential sets, and the app will detect and import them together.

The important part is that each credential gets its own row in the CSV. A simple multi-credential CSV can look like this:

```csv
id,name,scope,client_id,key_id,pem_path
1,Corp ABM,business,CLIENT_ID_1,KEY_ID_1,/Users/admin/certs/corp_abm.pem
2,School ASM,school,CLIENT_ID_2,KEY_ID_2,/Users/admin/certs/school_asm.pem
```

That lets me define separate friendly names and separate scopes while still packaging them in one deployable output.

If I want to export that CSV as a plist for a platform like Jamf that can handle raw plist deployment, I run:

```bash
python3 ABMManagedCredentialPackager.py --csv combo.csv --out plist --name combo.plist
```

That is where this feature becomes especially useful. I can push more than one managed context, and ABM Warranty will present those credentials as separate managed entries once the user imports them successfully.

At the same time, the app still keeps the distinction between managed credentials and manually added credentials. I can still add a separate unmanaged credential locally, and that one behaves differently because it was not delivered through managed preferences.

## Exporting Single and Multiple Credentials as a Mobileconfig

Plist output is useful when the management platform can write raw preference data directly, which is why it maps cleanly to tools like Jamf. Mobileconfig output solves a different deployment problem: it gives me a standard configuration-profile payload I can upload into MDM platforms that work best with profile-based preference delivery instead of raw plist deployment.

If I need the broadest compatibility across MDM tools, the mobileconfig route is usually the safer default because it packages the managed preferences in the same profile format admins are already used to deploying.

The command looks like this:

```bash
python3 ABMManagedCredentialPackager.py --csv single.csv --out mobileconfig --name single.mobileconfig
```

If I am packaging multiple credentials into one mobileconfig, I use the same idea with the multi-row CSV:

```bash
python3 ABMManagedCredentialPackager.py --csv combo.csv --out mobileconfig --name combo.mobileconfig
```

That gives me two clear deployment paths:

- plist output for tools like Jamf that can handle raw plist deployment
- mobileconfig output for MDMs that prefer configuration profile deployment

## What the User Sees After App Relaunch

After the managed preference is applied, I need to quit and relaunch the app so ABM Warranty can detect the new managed credentials. Once the app restarts, it shows a banner telling me that managed ABM credentials were detected and are ready to import.

That is the handoff point between the admin who packaged the credentials and the person receiving them on the Mac. The receiver still needs the passphrase that was used during packaging, because the app needs that passphrase to decrypt and import the managed credentials locally.

If the passphrase is wrong, the import fails. If it is correct, the app imports the credentials and the managed credential appears in the ABM Warranty settings.

## What Makes a Credential “Managed”

Once the import completes, the credential shows up in the app as managed. That is an important distinction.

A managed credential is not the same as a manually added credential. If the credential came from managed preferences, the person using the Mac should not be able to delete it the same way they could delete a credential they created manually.

That is intentional. It preserves the management boundary. The administrator controls the deployed managed credential, while the local user can still add their own separate manual credentials if they need to.

## Why This Deployment Model Matters

This managed-preferences workflow solves a very specific operational problem: I can prepare ABM Warranty credentials centrally, deploy them through MDM, protect them with an encrypted packaging flow, and still let the receiving Mac import them in a controlled way.

That is a much better workflow than walking people through manual credential entry one machine at a time, especially when I need a more repeatable deployment path.

For me, this is one of the most useful parts of 0.4.1 because it turns credential setup into something I can standardize and deploy cleanly instead of treating every endpoint like a one-off manual setup.

Yeah, I think that the hurdle that I wasn't as ready for, and the thing that kind of took me off guard was I came into the team. And I had built this thing and I was very comfortable where I was as the business owner operator, and I just assumed that I would continue to feel that level of comfort in continuing to build my book of business.

I think that when you're working in a large group, in a large team, especially one as large as Interlaced, it's go, it's going to inherently feel. Chaotic and it is chaotic. I think the one thing that I sh feel like I should have known, but am learning like the hard way, is you get to a certain point in your business and you're running it and you're comfortable and you have to make a decision.

Am I going to continue to grow and move into an uncomfortable state, or am I going to stay? In this business and grow it where I'm still comfortable. And for me, moving and selling the business really threw me into this like world of uncertainty and this world where I was not comfortable, but I. Before the business when I was an employee at various different companies, I really thrived off of that type of environment.

Being in a situation where I was  constantly learning new things and I was forced to learn that those things because I was helping drive that company forward by the initiatives that I was working on, it really harken back to those days and it really did reignite my passion for the technology and my   Desire to continue to learn and grow in technology.

I think that a little bit of that had waned as I had grown my business and moved into more of an operator type of role. So all in all, I feel like it was a good trade off. Traded off a lot of comfort for a more of a reinvigoration passion for learning and driving technology forward.

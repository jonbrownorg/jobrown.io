Tired of typing your admin account password whenever you try to install
software or change security settings on your Mac? A new feature in macOS
10.15 Catalina removes that requirement for Apple Watch owners. In
System Preferences \> Security & Privacy \> General, select the checkbox
for "Use your Apple Watch to unlock apps and your Mac." Then, whenever
an app asks for your account credentials, you can instead just
double-press the side button on your Apple Watch. Of course, if you
forgot to wear it or its battery has died, you can always fall back on
entering your password.

In iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, Apple added a feature that would have been even
more welcome before the advent of the App Library: the capability to
manage apps from Search. But it's still handy as a way to delete or
position an app you can't find on a Home screen page. Swipe down from
the middle of the Home screen to enter Search, after which you can work
with any app you see in Siri Suggestions or find with a search ➊. Touch
and hold an app to display its contextual menu ➋, including a Delete App
option. Or touch and hold it and start dragging to move it to a Home
screen page ➌. Bonus: you can even [drag an app out multiple
times](https://tidbits.com/2022/02/26/how-to-create-app-aliases-in-ios-15/)
to put it on multiple Home screen pages or in multiple folders!

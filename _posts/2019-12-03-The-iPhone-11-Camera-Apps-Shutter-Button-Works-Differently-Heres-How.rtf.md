With the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max, Apple changed
the way the Camera app's shutter button works in ways that could cause
confusion. Tapping it once still takes a single still photo, but if you
press and hold on the shutter button, it now captures a quick video.
(Previously, pressing and holding on the button took photos in burst
mode; to do that on the iPhone 11 models, slide the shutter button to
the left.) Once you've started taking a quick video, slide your finger
to the right to lock recording, so you don't have to keep holding the
button down. Tap the white shutter button to take a still image while
recording; tap the red record button to stop recording. For even easier
quick video recording, press and hold either of the volume buttons; a
single press still takes a photo. Note that quick videos always record
with mono sound and at a resolution of 1920-by-1440; for stereo sound
and the resolution set in Settings \> Camera, use the Camera app's Video
mode.

Given their integration into the Mac's Finder, it can be easy to forget
that online file sharing services like Dropbox, Google Drive, iCloud
Drive, and Microsoft OneDrive can be accessed using a Web browser by
anyone with your username and password. Obviously, you should always
have strong, unique passwords, but to be safe, it's best not to use
services designed for public file sharing to store unencrypted files
containing sensitive information like credit card numbers, Social
Security numbers, passport scans, privileged legal documents, financial
data, and so on. Keep such data secure on your Mac---outside of any
synced folders---where accessing it requires physical access to the
machine.

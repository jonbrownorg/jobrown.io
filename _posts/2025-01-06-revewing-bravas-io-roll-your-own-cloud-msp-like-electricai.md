### [Bravas.io](https://www.bravas.io/) is the MSP Best Kept Secret

Are you an MSP that is looking to offer a similar type of service to Electric AI? Have you ever wondered how they do it and how you could as well? Well wonder no longer because [Bravas.io](https://www.bravas.io/) is now offering white labeling services that can turn your MSP into a sleek service provider like Electric AI with a lot more features. Deeply integrate Bravas with your logo and provide limited access to the platform to your clients and involve them in the onboarding, offboarding and user provisioning process. Not only that but [Bravas.io](https://www.bravas.io/) offers SSO capabilities and leverages the best in passwordless technology to ensure that your devices and apps are secure on day one.

Now you can have that deep integration with an MDM, IDP and SSO platform with your branding all over it and you can start embedding that service offering deep into your MSP services. Now lets take a look at some MSP alternative services out there, services that are leveraging similar tech to their customer base, Electric.ai. Electric has stood out in the industry as being a future thinking MSP alternative. They are a service provider but the goal for them is to automate and streamline everything so fine tuned that you seldom ever need to open a traditional support ticket. In fact their deep integration with your communication platforms like Slack and Teams allows them to be right where you need them when you need them. 

Wait, isn't that something that any MSP can do at this point? Sure, Electric was just the first to tackle this model and push it forward, agressively. This model works because its low overhead means they can offer lower price points to their clients and lower support needs means that you can run a leaner and meaner IT services company. While Electric advertises themselves as an MSP alternative they are at their very core still an IT services and technology company. So how does Electric do this today? They partnered with Jumpcloud to create a deep integration with their MDM, IDP and SSO solution. Wait does that sound familiar? Its because [Bravas.io](https://www.bravas.io/) does all of these things too! 

In fact [Bravas.io](https://www.bravas.io/) does it all while ensuring that you are secure. Jumpcloud is secure do not get me wrong, but they havent fully caught on to passwordless for app provisioning within the SSO area. This is a game changer. If your at all interested give [Bravas.io](https://www.bravas.io/) a a try and check out their MSP offering and compare it to Jumpclouds offering and you make the decision. The thing here is that this model of IT service consultancy isn't going away, its going to become the new norm and I forsee that in just a few years, companies offering fully staffed helpdesk services will reduce by 50%.  

### What White Labeling offers your MSP

One of the best reasons to go with white labeled solutions is that you are keeping your technology offering centered around your name, and brand. You shouldn't just trust any white labeled service though, because you need to protect your brand. Remember you are building trust here and you need to ensure that whatever you put your name on has to perform. 

That where the team at Bravas really shine. They want you to succeed so you as an MSP partnering with them will be paired with a customer service representative to help transition your clients over to the Bravas platform easily and seamlessly. They will be available to provide support and help when you need it most and finally they will set you up to succeed by giving you the ability to suggest changes, and directly contribute ideas to their roadmap. 

Finally you will benefit greatly by their MSP pricing model which allows you to mark up the Bravas offering with your name on it as an advanced, integrated and streamlined new service line item that offers deep integration with Mac, Windows and acts as a standalone Identity Provider with full MDM and Single Sign On capabilities. 

### Takeaways

If you are looking for a way to take your MSP consultancy to the next level and have clients on multiple MDM platforms and Multiple sporadic SSO and IDPs consider starting to offer your own service offering to add value to your clients relationship. 

Having all these connections and ability to manage all these items is a true game changer and not only will it improve customer loyalty but it will decrease overhead and increase your overall profitability as well!

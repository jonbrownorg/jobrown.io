Over the past few months, there has been a spate of media reports about
how people may have been tracked without their knowledge using AirTags,
Apple's elegant location trackers. Like many mainstream media forays
into the tech world, the reports are often short on detail and sometimes
unclear on the reality of how the AirTags work. Nor is it clear that
there have been many successful cases of AirTag abuse, but the mere fact
that people are trying to use AirTags to stalk others is concerning.

Apple put significant effort into preventing such abuses, revolving
around three features:

-   **Safety alerts:** If you have an iPhone or iPad running iOS 14.5 or
    later and an unknown AirTag is traveling with you, your device will
    alert you to that fact. Although safety alerts aren't available for
    those using Android smartphones, Android users can download Apple's
    Tracker Detect app to scan manually.

-   **Safety sounds:** After an AirTag has been separated from its owner
    for several days, it will make a sound the next time it moves.

-   **NFC identification:** If you find an AirTag, you can hold it up to
    an iPhone or other NFC-capable smartphone to load a website that
    reveals the AirTag's serial number and the last four digits of the
    owner's phone number. The police can use this information to learn
    the owner's identity from Apple.

Sadly, those precautions haven't been sufficient either to dissuade all
would-be stalkers or to educate potential stalking victims (and let's be
real---dissuading stalkers is also a matter of educating people that
it's unethical, likely dangerous, and often illegal to abuse an AirTag
in this way). Apple has responded in two ways, one general, the other
specific to AirTags.​

### Personal Safety User Guide

Apple documents its products and services quite well, but the company
tends to generate many focused pages without much high-level
organization. It's all too easy to flail around within Apple's support
documentation looking for help if you don't know what search terms are
likely to work. In an effort to mitigate that problem for issues
surrounding personal safety, Apple has created the [Personal Safety User
Guide
website](https://support.apple.com/guide/personal-safety/welcome/web#cm),
also available as a [downloadable 56-page
PDF](https://help.apple.com/pdf/personal-safety/en_US/personal-safety-user-guide.pdf).

The Personal Safety User Guide brings together numerous Apple support
articles in two main sections:

-   **Review and take action:** The first section helps you review how
    your devices and apps are set up, with a focus on settings that
    could expose you to harm. It helps you manage sharing settings, look
    at location sharing, control your Home accessories, and more. You'll
    also learn how to block unknown sign-in attempts, document
    suspicious activity, delete suspicious content, and avoid fraudulent
    requests to share information, among much else. The main criticism
    here is that the section on AirTag safety doesn't explain or link to
    all the features Apple provides.

-   **Safety and privacy tools:** The second section is a bit more
    generic, providing support documentation that encourages you to take
    advantage of the features Apple has provided to protect your safety
    and privacy. Among other topics, it discusses passcodes, setting up
    Face ID and Touch ID, using two-factor authentication, seeing which
    apps are accessing your data, blocking unwanted calls and messages,
    and using Emergency SOS.

The Personal Safety Guide ends with three checklists, each of which
walks you through a series of steps. These are extremely useful because
almost no one would necessarily know or remember all the places to
check. The checklists help you:

-   See who has access to your device or accounts

-   Stop sharing with someone

-   Control how someone else can see your location

The Personal Safety User Guide website is best when you want an answer
to a specific question, but it doesn't lend itself to reading front to
back. For that, we recommend downloading the PDF, which you can read at
whatever depth you desire. But do at least scan the entire thing to get
a sense of what it contains should you need that information later.​

### Apple AirTag Announcement

Shortly after releasing the Personal Safety Guide, Apple also posted a
[short but detailed
statement](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/02/an-update-on-airtag-and-unwanted-tracking/)
on its website. In it, the company makes it clear that it is actively
working with law enforcement on all cases involving AirTag abuse. Apple
also says that it has updated its [unwanted tracking
documentation](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212227) to explain
AirTag safety features more clearly to users and to include resources
for those who feel their safety is at risk.

Apple also outlined important advancements
that will be coming to the AirTag and Find My network systems via
software updates later this year:

-   **New privacy warnings during AirTag setup:** To ensure that
    everyone understands the utility of AirTags and the implications of
    abuse, people setting up an AirTag for the first time will see a
    message that clearly states that AirTags are meant to track their
    own belongings, that tracking people without their consent is a
    crime in many places, that AirTags are designed to alert victims to
    their presence, and that law enforcement can request identifying
    information about the owner of an AirTag.

-   **Better alerts for AirPods:** Instead of an "Unknown Accessory
    Detected" alert when your iPhone detects Find My network-compatible
    AirPods traveling with you, the alert will specify that AirPods are
    involved, not an AirTag. (There are third-party Find My network
    accessories that will still generate this alert, such as the
    [Chipolo ONE
    Spot](https://tidbits.com/2021/08/24/chipolo-ahoy-the-one-spot-find-my-network-tracker-arrives/).)

-   **Refined unwanted tracking logic:** Apple will be updating its
    unwanted tracking alert system to notify users sooner that an
    unknown AirTag or Find My network accessory is traveling with them.

-   **Precision Finding for unknown AirTags:** Those with an iPhone 11,
    iPhone 12, or iPhone 13 will be able to take advantage of Find My's
    Precision Finding feature to home in on the location of an unknown
    AirTag. Previously, this capability was limited to your own AirTags.

-   **Display alerts with unknown AirTag sound:** When an unknown AirTag
    emits a sound to alert anyone nearby to its presence, and it's
    detected moving with your iPhone or iPad, an alert will also appear
    to help you play the sound again or use Precision Finding, if
    available. This should help when an unknown AirTag is in a place
    that blocks sound or if its speaker has been disabled.

-   **More obvious AirTag alert sound:** Apple will be adjusting the
    tone sequences to make an unknown AirTag's alert sound easier to
    hear and find.

Overall, these changes are welcome, and it's a testament to the care
Apple took when designing the AirTag and Find My network systems that it
can make such enhancements through software updates---no hardware
changes are necessary. It's also good to see Apple taking the
problem---however small it might actually be---seriously and working to
reduce it even further.

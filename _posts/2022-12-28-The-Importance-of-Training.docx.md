We all learn differently. While some individuals can read instructions
one time and know what to do, there are others who benefit from being
taught visually or by 'doing'. Regardless of how you learn, having a
single approach for everyone isn't ideal.

The one thing we do know about learning, or training, is that when it
comes to cybersecurity, repetition is important. That doesn't mean
taking the same course every quarter, or re reading the manual once a
year. Smart and safe cyber practices are critical to your business's
success. And human error is the number one reason that breaches occur.
You and your colleagues are your company's greatest risk, but also your
greatest asset.

**Our Approach**

We offer ongoing and interactive training. Why? Because to stay secure,
you need keep up with cybercriminals and their ever-changing tactics.
***This isn't a one-and-done approach***. Cyber-crimes are always
adapting to the way we live and work, so **we** need to adapt to
mitigate the risks. These nefarious characters want to catch you off
guard. Which means that as soon as a new device is released, a pop
culture story becomes news, or a pandemic hits the world, they are ready
to dupe you. That might mean they'll come after your money, your
identification, or hit you with a slow burn that gets them into your
business, and you don't realize it until months later...but they are
there lurking and waiting for their next score.

**Everyday Habits**

Our approach mixes video training, with integrated tools that teach on
the job. This will help to address not only the variety of ways that
people learn, but also the variety of ways that you can be targeted! If
you are a current client and want to ensure that you're maximizing the
tools and resources that we offer, or you're new here and interested in
learning more about how you can work with our team to protect your
business, let's talk today!

Rather than just a word processor Pages does much more it's also a
Desktop Publisher "DTP".

At one stage around 2009 Pages was actually far superior to Microsoft
Word for desktop publishing however Microsoft Word has started to fill
those gaps and is a good PAID for alternative.

But let's get back to the fact Pages is a really powerful app and now
if you own a Mac or an iOS device it is free.

If it's not already installed open the App store on your Mac or
iPad/iPhone and search for Pages.

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20200624Pa/image12.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />

When you first open Pages you will be shown the Template chooser
window, the templates are one of the reasons Pages is such a good choice
for creating your documents, they look professional, they're up to date
styling wise and they speed up any kind of DTP.

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20200624Pa/image27.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />

In this tutorial I'm going to select one of the Newsletter Templates,
after selecting the template you want to use your Pages document will be
pre-filled with text and images that you can change.

If like me you are going to use the template for desktop publishing
rather than word processing (layout is more important) then to see the
page thumbnails of the document click the view button top left corner
and choose Page Thumbnails.

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20200624Pa/image19.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />

You'll now see a list of the Pages within the document on the left-hand
side.

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20200624Pa/image20.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />

In my example I would like to create a new section from the first page
or title page, if you ctrl or right click on the page you want to
duplicate you will see a handy "duplicate" option, however this will
then duplicate both pages 1 & 2 , To just duplicate the first page
layout you need to first Convert the document to a page layout, Go to
the File menu \> Convert to page layout.

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20200624Pa/image1.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="300" />

After we have done this you may notice that when you select the first
page thumbnail on the left hand side only that page is highlighted
whereas before converting to a layout both pages are selected at the
same time.

Right click on the page you want to use again as a template and select
duplicate:

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20200624Pa/image4.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />

Now instead of having 4 pages as both page 1 & 2 are duplicated you
only get a second copy of the chosen page.

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20200624Pa/image21.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />

You'll notice that the text entry areas have disappeared but don't
worry we'll just recreate those now, my first tip is to enable the show
layout and show invisibles, which can be found in the view
menu:

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20200624Pa/image2.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="300" />

Next click on the Text button which will place text box in the page you
are looking at:

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20200624Pa/image8.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />

You'll notice if you drag the text box it will align to yellow
guidelines which place the text box top, left, right and centre to the
page.

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20200624Pa/image9.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />

Next, you'll want to drag the text box using the boxes that appear on
the corners to fit the page, again following the yellow
guidelines.

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20200624Pa/image6.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />

To move the image into the text to allow the text to wrap around it,
simply right click on the image and cut it then click into the text box
and paste it.

You'll notice that the image no longer allows the text to
wrap:

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20200624Pa/image3.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />

So now you will want to open the Format menu:

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20200624Pa/image7.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />

Click on the image to highlight it and then click on the Arrange tab
from the format menu.

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20200624Pa/image14.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />

Next click on move to page.

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20200624Pa/image15.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />

Now you will see the text wrap option for that image:

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20200624Pa/image13.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />

I have chosen around in this example, which makes the text wrap around
the image.

Next drag the image into place.

The text will wrap nicely around the text

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20200624Pa/image22.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />


Next to format the text using the style provided in the template select
the Text tab from the format menu and choose the body style.

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20200624Pa/image24.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />

And to style the title choose one of the title styles from the same
tab.

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20200624Pa/image23.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />

Now you'll notice we have covered most of the basics for using Pages as
a desktop publisher.

Lastly let's take a quick look at the image options as these are some
of the best features in Pages.

Place your cursor in the text roughly where you want to place the image
and paste it, it's easier to copy the image from preview or Photos or
even a website rather than drag and drop in this case as Pages may try
and apply some formatting that we don't want.

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20200624Pa/image26.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />

Again, from the Format menu with the image selected click on Arrange &
then Move to Page:

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20200624Pa/image25.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />

Again chose the most appropriate Text Wrap I have gone with Around
again:

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20200624Pa/image11.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />

Draw a shape over the top of the image select Shape from the toolbar
menu, here I have drawn a star:

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20200624Pa/image18.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />

Now hold shift click the shape you have drawn & the image so both are
selected, now from the format menu choose Image \> Mask with selection,
or Press Command Shift M.

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20200624Pa/image17.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />

With the menu that appears below the new image mask you can quickly
edit the mask size and position of the image.

Right click on the Image Mask and choose Edit Mask to re-open this menu
again.

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20200624Pa/image16.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20200624Pa/image5.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />

You'll notice if you select the Image and the Image Tab from the format
menu there are some controls to adjust the Image, here I have slightly
increased the Exposure & saturation to make the image more
vibrant.

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20200624Pa/image10.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />

Hopefully now you have a good idea of how to use Pages as a desktop
publisher to create and modify stunning layouts.

Don't forget Pages documents can be edited from any computer via
iCloud.com as well as your iPads & iPhones. This makes collaborating on
documents easy.

As of 2020 Apple is discontinuing the iBooks Author program that was
being used to make ePub files on the Mac, now you can do that from
within Pages, so get practicing those dtp skills!

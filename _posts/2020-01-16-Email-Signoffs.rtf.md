Email has been around for decades, but there are no hard-and-fast rules
for how you should close a message with either the signoff or the
signature block. If you've always wondered about the best ways to finish
off a message or are uncomfortable with what you've been doing, here's
our advice.

**Use the form of your name that you want the recipient to use.** If
your given name is Mohammed, but everyone calls you Mo, use that for
signing most of your messages. Otherwise, they'll have no idea you
prefer the shorter version. (The reverse is true too; if you're not sure
how to address someone, look at their signoff for a hint.)

However, for formal correspondence with people or organizations who
would usually refer to you as Ms. So-and-so, stick with Elizabeth
instead of Betty.

**Match the formality of your closing to that of your recipient.** When
writing business email to someone you don't know, it's best to stay
formal at first with closings like "Sincerely" or "Yours truly." Once
you know the person a little better, you could move on to "Kind regards"
or "Best wishes."

With friends, family, and people you know well, try "Cheers," "Talk
soon" (if you mean it), or even a quick "Later." Finally, it's never
inappropriate to use "Thanks!" if you truly are thanking them for
something.

**Create context-specific signature blocks.** We all wear many different
hats in today's world. Your email signature should match the role you're
in for the particular email message. For instance:

-   Apple-tab-span}Work email should probably include at least
    your title, department, and formal organization name. If you work
    for a large organization, you may have been provided with a template
    for your signature. If much of your communication takes place
    outside of email, include your phone number and postal
    address.
-   Apple-tab-span}If you serve on a nonprofit board or have a
    side gig---like as an author or musician---messages you send in
    those contexts need their own focused signatures with appropriate
    links.
-   Apple-tab-span}For email to friends and family, there's no
    need for a signature at all.

**Avoid clever sayings and inspirational quotes.** Although it's
tempting to instill some personality into your signature with a quote,
don't do it. The quote might be entertaining the first time someone sees
it, but after that, it's just one more thing to ignore. Part of
combatting email overload is to keep messages short and to the point, so
you want your signature to have less text than the message itself.

**No fancy formatting or pictures.** Along the same lines of avoiding
quotes, keep your signature simple. Stick to plain text and links, and
don't insert your company's logo or a picture of your pony just because
you can. Just imagine how awkward it would be if someone were to look at
a long email thread and see your signature repeated ad infinitum, taking
up more space than your actual messages.

**Don't assume anyone will read your signature.** Keep in mind that some
email apps automatically hide signatures so your recipients may not see
it at all. There's usually a way to view a hidden signature, but never
assume that everyone will see it.

**Consider automation tools for inserting signoffs and signatures.**
Many email programs, including [Mail on the
Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mail/create-and-use-email-signatures-mail11943/13.0/mac/10.15){:rel="nofollow"},
let you create multiple signatures and attach them to messages you send
from specific email addresses. For even more flexibility, think about
using a macro utility like [Keyboard
Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/){:rel="nofollow"} or a text expansion
tool like [TextExpander](https://textexpander.com/){:rel="nofollow"} to insert
custom signoff and signature combinations. Such options are commonplace
on the Mac but much less so in iOS or iPadOS.

You're on vacation with your family, staying in an Airbnb, with multiple
Apple devices to connect to the apartment's Wi-Fi. Typing the password
repeatedly would be a pain, but happily, Apple has added a
password-sharing feature to all its operating systems. Once you enter
the password on your iPhone, whenever someone else---or another of your
devices---tries to connect to the Wi-Fi network, your iPhone will prompt
you to share the password. Tap Share Password and then Done. It's also a
great way to share your home Wi-Fi password with a visitor. (For
password sharing to work, both devices must have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on
and Personal Hotspot disabled, and you and the other person must have
each other's Apple ID email address saved in Contacts.)

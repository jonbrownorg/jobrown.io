It's easy to share a single photo from your iPhone or iPad with a
friend, but if you want to share a bunch of photos or lengthy videos,
sending them in Messages or Mail might not work or could impact your
(and your recipients') data caps. In iOS 12, Apple added a clever
feature that instead uploads the files to iCloud and lets you share a
simple link that your recipients can use to view and download. Use this
approach and your messages will send and be received faster and more
reliably.

This feature requires that you use iCloud Photos (previously called
iCloud Photo Library). If you're not already set up with iCloud Photos,
you can turn it on in Settings \> Photos, but be aware that you will
likely need to [pay for more iCloud
storage](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201238){:rel="nofollow"} (\$0.99
per month for 50 GB, \$2.99 for 200 GB, and \$9.99 for 2 TB). Your
recipients don't need to use iCloud Photos, though, and in fact, they
can use any device or operating system.

### Send iCloud Links

It's easy to send an iCloud Link. Follow these steps:

1.  Open the Photos app on an iPhone or iPad running iOS 12.

2.  In any view with multiple thumbnails showing, tap Select.

3.  Tap one or more photos or videos to select them.

4.  Tap the Share <img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2019/icloudlink/image1.png" width="16"  style="margin-top: -8px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"  /> button.

5.  In the bottom row of icons in the Share sheet, tap Copy iCloud Link.
    You may have to scroll to the right to see it.

6.  After iOS prepares the items for sharing, it puts the iCloud link on
    the clipboard.

7.  Switch to whatever app you're using to communicate and paste the
    link by pressing in a text area and tapping Paste in the control
    that appears. Messages will generate a preview thumbnail for you;
    other apps will display a Web URL to icloud.com.

### Manage iCloud Links

By default, items you share via an iCloud link are stored for only 30
days. That's a good thing---you don't have to worry about things hanging
around forever. However, it does mean that your recipients need to get
around to viewing or downloading within that time. And what if you want
to remove access before the 30 days are up? Plus, what if you want to
send the iCloud link to another person---how do you get it again?

Here's the trick. In Photos, tap For You, then tap your collection under
Recently Shared to open it. Then tap the blue more

display a menu with two options:

-   To get the link again to send to another person, tap Copy iCloud
    Link.

-   To remove the files from iCloud, tap Stop Sharing.

### Receive iCloud Links

When someone sends you an iCloud link, opening it is as simple as
tapping or clicking the link, just like any other Web URL. (As with
other Web links, if you're receiving an iCloud link in Messages, you'll
see a thumbnail preview instead of the URL.)

If you're receiving the iCloud link on an iOS device, tapping it opens
the collection in the For You tab of Photos with a convenient Add All
button for bringing the photos into your own library. If you don't want
all of them, you can instead tap Select to pick a few.

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2019/icloudlink/image5.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />

However, opening the iCloud link on a Mac or any other device opens it
in a Web browser, with a Photos-like display. By default, all the photos
are selected, although you can click the blue
<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2019/icloudlink/image6.png" width="16"  style="margin-top: -8px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"  /> checkmark for any one to deselect it or
click Deselect All. Clicking the round spot where the checkmark was
selects an image again. Once the photos you want are selected, click
Download.

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2019/icloudlink/image7.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />

Alternatively, if you just want to look at the photos online, click any
photo to expand it. All the other photos appear in a scrolling bar
below, and you can click them or use the arrow keys to navigate through
them.

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2019/icloudlink/image8.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />

So next time you have some photos to share and don't want to waste
bandwidth or mess around with shared albums, try sending an iCloud link
instead.

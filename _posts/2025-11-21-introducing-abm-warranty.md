## Introducing ABM Warranty for macOS  
_A smarter, faster way to understand and manage warranty coverage across your organization._

<div 
  class="w-full max-w-4xl mx-auto my-0 p-6 rounded-xl overflow-hidden bg-cover bg-center"
  style="background-image: url('/images/macos/tahoe/bg.png');"

    />
</div>


If you manage Apple devices at scale, you already know that **Apple Business Manager (ABM)** provides warranty data — but in practice, it’s extremely limited. It doesn’t provide workflow-friendly insights, it doesn’t surface actionable coverage states, and it doesn’t help you wrangle the ever-growing complexity of **AppleCare+ renewals** across hundreds or thousands of devices.

That gap is exactly why I built **ABM Warranty**, a new macOS app — now available in the Mac App Store:

[➡️ **Download on the Mac App Store** ](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/abm-warranty/id6755319278?mt=12) 

This tool brings a truly **enterprise-grade warranty dashboard** to ABM, powered entirely by the **official ABM API**, wrapped in a clean macOS 15 “Tahoe” interface.

## Why Build This Tool?

As an Apple device admin myself, I’ve lost count of how many times I needed answers like:

- *Which devices are about to expire?*  
- *Which ones are eligible for AppleCare+ renewal?*  
- *How many are already out of coverage and need to be replaced?*  
- *How many Macs, iPhones, or iPads are in each warranty state?*  
- *Which devices have multiple overlapping AppleCare+ events in their history?*

ABM technically has this data — but it’s buried, and not consumable at scale.

**ABM Warranty solves that** by pulling structured, rich warranty data directly from Apple’s backend using your organization’s ABM API key.

## How It Works

### 1. Create an API Key in Apple Business Manager  
To connect ABM Warranty to your environment, you'll need a **Client ID**, **Key ID**, and the **PEM private key** downloaded from ABM.

In ABM (Apple Business Manager):

1. Go to **Settings → Apps and Books → Access**  
2. Select **Generate API Key**  
3. Download the `.pem` key file  
4. Copy your **Key ID**, and **Client ID**

This is the same API authentication flow Apple documents for their Business APIs.

### 2. Install ABM Warranty  
[➡️ **Download on the Mac App Store** ](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/abm-warranty/id6755319278?mt=12) 

<div 
  class="w-full max-w-4xl mx-auto my-0 p-6 rounded-xl overflow-hidden bg-cover bg-center"
  style="background-image: url('/images/macos/tahoe/bg.png');"
>
    <img 
      src="/assets/images/blog/2025/warranty/3.png" 
      alt="ABM Warranty"
      class="mx-auto"
    />
</div>

The app runs on macOS 12 or later, and is optimized for macOS 15.

### 3. Configure Credential Settings  
Open **Settings** within ABM Warranty and enter:

- **Client ID**
- **Key ID**
- **Base URL** (defaults to Apple’s production API endpoint)
- **PEM File** (select the private key downloaded from ABM)

Once credentials are saved, you can immediately fetch device inventory and coverage details.

<div 
  class="w-full max-w-4xl mx-auto my-0 p-6 rounded-xl overflow-hidden bg-cover bg-center"
  style="background-image: url('/images/macos/tahoe/bg.png');"

    <img 
      src="/assets/images/blog/2025/warranty/2.png"

      class="mx-auto"
    />
</div>

## Roadmap – What’s Coming in v0.2.0?

I’m already collecting feedback, and here are the major features planned:

### 🚀 Enhanced Auth & Deployment (JAMF)  
- Ability to pull API credentials and PEM cert from **JAMF-managed preferences**  
- Support for **reading the private key directly from Keychain**  
- Improved automatic certificate selection UI  

### 🔧 Coverage Expansion  
- Dedicated filters for **YTD Expired**  
- More granular renewal forecasting  
- Better visualization of multi-event AppleCare histories

### 🏫 Apple School Manager Support  
ASM shares much of the same API structure as ABM, and early work is underway to support both.

### 🎨 Additional UI Enhancements  
- Improved layout constraints  
- More refined Tahoe-style materials  
- Multi-column detail view options

And of course:

### 💬 **I want your feedback!**

It's a constant refrain in many homes---a kid clamoring to use an iPad
or iPhone to play games, watch videos, or chat with friends. As a
parent, you know too much screen time is bad, especially when it affects
homework or family dinners. At the same time, an iOS device may be
essential for communication and schoolwork.

In iOS 12, Apple introduced Screen Time, which shows how much time you
spend on your own device, and helps you control your usage---see our
recent article for details. But Screen Time also has parental controls.
They're best managed with [Family
Sharing](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201088) from
your own iOS device, so if you haven't already done so, tap Settings \>
*YourName* \> Set Up Family Sharing and follow the instructions. (You
can also set up Screen Time directly on the child's device---tap Use
Screen Time Passcode to set a passcode that prevents the child from
overriding limits.)

With Family Sharing set up, go to Settings \> Screen Time and notice
your children's names in the new Family section. Tap a child's name to
set Screen Time limitations and restrictions on their iOS devices.
Initially, Screen Time walks you through an assistant that explains the
main features and helps you set some basic limitations. It also prompts
you to create a four-digit parent passcode, which you'll need to adjust
settings in the future or override time limits.

Subsequently, when you tap your child's name, you'll see Screen Time's
standard sections for Downtime, App Limits, Always Allowed, and Content
& Privacy Restrictions. For a full explanation of the first three, see
our previous article; we'll focus on what's different for children and
on Content & Privacy Restrictions here.

### Downtime
---

Downtime is useful for blocking all device usage during a time when your
child should be sleeping, doing homework, or just not using the screen.
You can set only one time period, so if you want to control usage on a
more complex schedule, you'll need to do that in another way.

For a child, the Downtime screen has a Block at Downtime option that you
must enable to actually block access to the device during the scheduled
time. If it's off, and the child tries to use the device during that
time, they'll be able to tap Ignore Limit just like an adult can. That
might be appropriate for a teenager who may need to check email late at
night to find details for tomorrow's sports practice. With Block at
Downtime on, however, the only override is with the parent passcode.

### App Limits
---
As our previous article noted, App Limits specify how long a category of
apps---or a specific app---may be used each day, with the time resetting
at midnight. For children, you might want to try restricting nothing for
a week, and see what apps they're using and for how long. Then have "the
talk" about appropriate use of digital devices and agree on limits.

You can tap Customize Days to allow more time on weekends, for instance,
and you can exempt an app from all limitations in the Always Allowed
screen.

Once your child hits an app limit, Screen Time will block them from
using the app, with the only override being your parent passcode.

### Content & Privacy Restrictions
---
Here's where you'll find all the previous parental controls, which let
you turn on a wide variety of restrictions. To get started, enable the
Content & Privacy Restrictions switch. There are three basic sections
here:

-   **Store and Content Restrictions:** Use these to control app
    downloading and deletion, what sort of content can be downloaded
    from Apple's online stores, whether or not Web content should be
    filtered, and more.\
    <img src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2018/parentalcontrols/image5.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="750" />

-   **Privacy Restrictions:** The entries here depend on what apps are
    installed, but the main question is if you want to allow location
    sharing.

-   **Allow Changes:** These items relate to settings on the iOS device
    itself. You might want to disallow passcode and account changes, and
    volume limit changes, if you've set a maximum volume in Settings \>
    Music \> Volume Limit.

### Reports
---
At the top of its main screen for the child, Screen Time reports on
usage for both the current day and the last 7 days, showing a graph of
screen time by hour or day, with color coding to indicate which app
categories were in use. Review this report regularly to see if you need
to adjust the Downtime or App Limit settings. Your child can also check
the same report directly on their device in Settings \> Screen Time.

Screen Time's controls are good but not perfect. Enterprising kids have
discovered workarounds such as changing the device's time setting and
deleting and redownloading apps. So don't see Screen Time as a
guaranteed technological solution---it's just another tool in your
parenting toolkit.

Do you sometimes find it difficult to read articles on your iPhone
because of ads, banners, extraneous layout, social media icons, and
too-small fonts? We certainly do, and there's often a quick fix for the
myriad ills of modern Web pages: Safari Reader. Whenever you see the
Safari Reader icon to the left of the site's domain name in the
address bar, tap it to switch to a cleaner view that dispenses with all
the unnecessary trimmings and presents the content in a larger, more
readable font. Tap the font icon at the right side of the address
bar in Safari Reader to change the font, font size, and background
color. Safari Reader isn't always available, and it can occasionally
fail to format an article properly, but it's a big win when you can use
it.

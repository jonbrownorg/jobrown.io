By default, Safari on the Mac hides full Web addresses---technically
known as URLs---from you, showing just the site name in the Smart Search
field at the top of the window. If you click in the field or press
Command-L, the full URL appears, which is good for checking that you're
really where you think you should be and not on some dodgy site. It's
also useful if you need to copy just a portion of the URL to share or
otherwise work with. To make that check easier, go to Safari \>
Preferences \> Advanced and next to Smart Search Field, select "Show
full website address." Then you can verify that the URL looks right with
a glance.

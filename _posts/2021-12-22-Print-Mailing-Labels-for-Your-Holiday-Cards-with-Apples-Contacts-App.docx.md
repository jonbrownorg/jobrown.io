If mailing your holiday cards (which you designed in Photos with a
plug-in like
[Motif](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/motif-print-photo-memories/id1404636482?mt=12)
or [Mimeo
Photos](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mimeo-photos/id1282504627?mt=12),
right?) is made harder by having to write addresses on envelopes, you
can skip the handwriting step this year. Although many people don't
realize this, it's easy to print mailing labels on standard label stock
using the Contacts app on the Mac. You can even add a personal touch by
including a graphic and using a custom color and font choice. Follow
these steps:

1.  In Contacts, choose File > New Group to create an empty group into
    which you can collect your card recipients. Name the group something
    like Holiday Cards.


2.  Click All Contacts to see your full collection of contacts, and then
    drag your recipients from the center column to copy them into the
    Holiday Cards group. Note that you have to click and hold briefly
    before Contacts lets you start dragging a contact. You can drag
    contacts one at a time or select several at once and drag the entire
    selection. This doesn't move contacts out of All Contacts---you're
    just adding them to the Holiday Cards group, which functions like a
    playlist in Music.

3.  Once the Holiday Cards group contains all your recipients, click its
    name in the sidebar, and then choose File > Print to open the Print
    dialog.


4.  To set up your cards, you need to see details in the Print dialog,
    so at the bottom of the Print dialog, click the Show Details button
    (if it's already called Hide Details, you're all set). You also need
    to see the special controls for Contacts, so make sure Contacts is
    chosen from the pop-up menu underneath the page range fields. Then
    from the Style pop-up menu, choose Mailing Labels.

5.  Beneath the Style pop-up menu, make sure Layout is selected, and
    then in the Layout view, from the Page pop-up menus, choose the
    manufacturer of your labels and the number associated with the
    labels. ([Avery 5160](https://www.avery.com/products/labels/5160) is
    a particularly common label type and is readily available at office
    supply stores and online.)


6.  Click Label to switch to the Label view. From the Addresses pop-up
    menu, choose the type of address you're using. Home is likely the
    most appropriate; if you choose All, Contacts will print both Home
    and Work addresses if available. You can also select the checkboxes
    for Company and Country here, and if you print the country, you can
    exclude your own country, which makes it easy to include overseas
    friends and relatives without printing the country for most people.

7.  Although the defaults are fine, you can change the color of the
    label text, select a small image to print next to each contact, and
    change the font.


8.  It's time to print, but not on your label stock just yet! Click the
    Print button to print a draft of your labels on plain paper. You'll
    use this draft for two things---checking the addresses for accuracy
    and verifying that the labels will print properly on the label
    stock. To check if the labels will print correctly, stack a page
    from the draft on top of a sheet of blank labels, and then hold them
    up to a bright light or sunlit window. You should be able to see
    whether the positioning is right---it should be in most cases. If
    not, make sure you've chosen the right label in the Print dialog,
    and if all else fails, create a custom label with your own margins
    and gutters to make it work. You may also want to increase or
    decrease the font size, making sure that even your longest addresses
    will fit.


9.  Once you've fixed addresses for everyone who has moved recently and
    verified your positioning, you can print for real on your label
    stock.

There's only one limitation to using Contacts to print your labels. If
you're a perfectionist, you might want to customize how the names of
couples appear on the label. Even though it has the necessary Spouse
relationship field that links contacts together, Contacts doesn't
support different name formats on labels. For instance, if you're
sending a card to a couple who share a last name, you might want the
name line to read "Barack and Michelle Obama." The same goes for couples
who don't share a last name, like "Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi."
The solution for this picky conundrum is Belight Software's $9.99
[Swift Publisher](https://www.swiftpublisher.com/) app, which lets you
create label templates using individual fields from Contacts.

But that's overkill for most of us, who care more about what's inside
the envelope. Most of the work comes in selecting people, making sure
their addresses are right, and updating those that have
changed---actually printing labels takes only a few minutes. As you
stick your labels on envelopes, you can revel in the knowledge that it
will go even faster next year!

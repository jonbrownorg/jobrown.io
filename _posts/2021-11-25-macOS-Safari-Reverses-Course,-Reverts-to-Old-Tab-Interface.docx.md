## Safari 15.1 Reverses Course, Reverts to Old Tab Interface

With the betas of Safari 15 on the Mac and iPad, Apple experimented with
a variety of interface tweaks related to tabs. By the time Safari 15
shipped, however, Apple had pulled back on the more radical changes from
the betas, offering the new Compact Tab Bar layout and colorized tab bar
as options. Even with the more traditional Separate Tab Bar layout,
however, tabs appeared as buttons above your favorites, a switch from
earlier versions of Safari. With Safari 15.1 in macOS and iPadOS 15.1,
Apple has reverted the Separate Tab Bar layout even further, making the
tabs look like, well, tabs, moving them below the favorites, and
eliminating the colorized tab bar (it remains an option in iOS 15.1).
The Compact Tab Bar option remains available for those who prefer it,
but if you've been feeling the sand shifting under your feet, it's not
your imagination---tabs really did change in Safari 15.1.

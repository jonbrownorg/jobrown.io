Most Apple Watch users charge their watch every night, putting it on a
charger as part of a bedtime routine. If that's you, make sure you're
not missing one of the Apple Watch's best features: nightstand mode.
When you enable it in the iPhone's Watch app, in General > Nightstand
Mode, a charging Apple Watch displays the charging status, current time
and date (in a large, easily readable font), and the time of any alarm
you've set. It uses a green color that won't shock your eyes in the
middle of the night, and after a minute, the screen goes completely
dark. To see it again, tap the watch or---even better!---the surface
it's on. The screen lights up for 10 seconds before going dark again.
(And yes, we love the little [classic Mac
stand](https://www.elago.com/w-stand_apple-watch/w3-stand-white).)

The internet has gone from strength to strength and part of the beauty of it is the fact that it enables us all to communicate freely with people everywhere in the world. Now with the growth of Wi-Fi we have allowed ourselves to create devices which also connect to the internet and deliver or transfer data within a network. While this connectivity is amazing, the unfortunate downside is that each internet connected individual on the planet has their own networks and their own data that can fall victim to theft by black hat hackers.

And so we believe that by raising awareness of these vulnerabilities and educating the public on how to keep themselves safe, we can take steps towards an internet that is safe from attack.

So without further ado, here are 31 cybersecurity tips for businesses to protect themselves.

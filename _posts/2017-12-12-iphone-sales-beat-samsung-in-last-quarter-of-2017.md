Samsung came in second at 25.1%. Despite Samsung’s negative ads mocking different iPhones, aiming to steal customers from Apple, Apple still dominated the smartphone market in the United States. Apple also sold a total of 46.7 million iPhones worldwide, reaching a quarterly revenue of $52.6 billion.

For the upcoming first quarter of 2018, investors expect Apple to have record-breaking performance with its new iPhone X sales appearing in Q1 results. Apple has estimated revenue between $84 billion and $87 billion for Q1 2018.

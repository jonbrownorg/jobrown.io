## Apple Radically Improved Multitasking in iPadOS 15. Here's How to Use It

Multitasking has long been a mess on the iPad, not so much because it
didn't work but because it was tough to memorize the secret swipes
necessary to put multiple apps into Split View, work with multiple
windows in apps that supported them, and hide and show what you wanted
in Slide Over. In iPadOS 15, Apple hasn't changed the underlying
multitasking capabilities much, but it has made them far more
discoverable with onscreen controls and tips that supplement the
previous gestures.

### Use the Multitasking Menu

Most important is the new multitasking menu button that appears in the
top center of every app, represented by •••. Tap it to reveal a control
with three options---Full Screen, Split View, and Slide Over---and then
tap one of those to put the current app into that mode. From left:

-   **Full Screen:** When only a single app is showing, the leftmost
    button is selected. When you have an app in Split View or Slide
    Over, tap the Full Screen button to make that app the only one
    onscreen.

-   **Split View:** Tap the middle button to shove the current app to
    the left edge of the screen, revealing the Home screen and the Dock.
    A little lozenge replaces the multitasking menu, telling you that
    you're working with Split View and to choose another app. Tap any
    other app to open it (on the right side) with the current app (on
    the left side), and remember that you can resize each app using the
    handle on the black bar in the middle.

-   **Slide Over:** In the current app window, tap the rightmost button
    to push the app to the side of the screen, again revealing the Home
    screen and the Dock and showing a lozenge that tells you that you're
    working with Slide Over and to choose another app. Tap any other to
    open it full screen but with the current app floating above it in
    Slide Over mode, and remember that you can hide the Slide Over app
    easily by swiping it to the right.

### Use the App Switcher

Apple also made it much easier to see and manage your Split View
combinations by using the App Switcher. Once you go into it by swiping
up from the bottom of the screen (or double-pressing the Home button, if
your iPad has one), you have several multitasking-related options:

-   **Switch among apps:** Tap any app, Split View combination, or Slide
    Over app (located on the right side of the App Switcher) to switch
    to it.

-   **Make a Split View:** Drag any app or window onto another one to
    combine them into a Split View (as is shown with Drive and Docs
    below). Before you start to drag, pause for a moment to pick up the
    app; drag until the items turn into icon-emblazoned gray rectangles.

-   **Replace a Split View app:** Drag any app or window onto the left
    or right side of a Split View combination to replace that app or
    window.

-   **Break a Split View combination:** Drag the left or right side of a
    Split View combination off until it displays as a full-screen
    thumbnail.

In the screenshot above, note the red arrow pointing to the little
stacked square icons above the Safari Split View windows. Those indicate
that the app in question has multiple windows. Tap the icon to display
just that app's windows in the App Switcher.

### Use the Shelf

The App Switcher may make it easier to see and switch among multiple
windows in apps, but another new multitasking feature, the Shelf, is
even more useful. When you use the Dock or a search to open an app with
multiple windows available, the Shelf displays them all at the bottom of
the screen. The Shelf doesn't appear when you switch to an app using the
App Switcher or four-finger swipe, but you can bring it up at any time
by tapping the multitasking menu button at the top of the screen.

When you're looking at items on the Shelf, tap one to switch to it. You
can also swipe up on windows on the Shelf to close them. As soon as you
tap anywhere else in the app to start working, the Shelf disappears.

### Use Center Windows

In at least some apps with sidebars, such as Mail and Notes, you can now
open an item like a message or a note in its own window in the center of
the screen. That's useful for previewing the full content of the item,
and you can swipe down on the multitasking menu button to put the window
on the Shelf, which keeps it available for quick reference while you
work on something else. To create a center window, touch and hold the
item in the sidebar and then tap Open in New Window. To close it, tap
Close or swipe up on its Shelf thumbnail.

### Use the Multitasking Keyboard Shortcuts

If you're seriously interested in using multitasking on an iPad, you're
probably also working with a physical keyboard much of the time. In
iPadOS 15, Apple added a useful set of keyboard shortcuts that you can
learn about by pressing and holding the Globe key and then tapping the
Multitasking tab at the bottom. It may take a little while to
internalize the shortcuts, but if you do most of your work on an iPad,
you will probably find the effort worthwhile.

If you like the idea of multitasking on the iPad but have never been
able to remember all the necessary gestures, iPadOS 15's changes will be
welcome. Give them a try---we think they finally make multitasking
obvious enough for everyone.

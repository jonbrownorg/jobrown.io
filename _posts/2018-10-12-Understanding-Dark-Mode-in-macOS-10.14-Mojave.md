The feature Apple is promoting most heavily with macOS 10.14 Mojave is
Dark mode, which the company advertises as "a dramatic new look that
helps you focus on your work... as toolbars and menus recede into the
background." Let's look at what Apple has done with Dark mode, after
which you'll have a better idea of what to think about while trying it.

### Enable Dark Mode
---
First, to turn Dark mode on, go to System Preferences \> General and
click the Dark thumbnail to the right of Appearance. Mojave immediately
switches to Dark mode, turning light backgrounds dark and swapping the
text color from dark to light.

While you're in System Preferences, click over to the Desktop & Screen
Saver preference pane. If you scroll down in the Desktop Pictures list,
you'll discover a bunch of new wallpapers that blend well with Dark
mode.

### Dark Mode Support and Controls
---
You'll notice that the color change takes place instantly not just in
the Finder, but also in any apps that support Dark mode. Most of Apple's
apps support Dark mode and third-party developers are rapidly adding
support to their apps as well. However, Dark mode requires explicit
support from apps, so older apps that aren't being updated will maintain
their standard dark-on-light color schemes.

Some apps, such as Maps and Mail, give you additional options that
change just how dark they get. In Maps, choose View \> Use Dark Map to
toggle between a dark map style and the familiar map style that mimics a
paper map. Similarly, in Mail, go to Mail \> Preferences \> Viewing and
deselect "Use dark backgrounds for messages" to return to a white
background.

If you generally like Dark mode but have trouble reading light text on a
dark background due to the reduced contrast, you may be able to choose a
different font or style in the app's preferences that makes the text
more readable. Apps like Mail give you a fair amount of that sort of
control.

For even more control over contrast, open System Preferences \>
Accessibility \> Display. There you'll find a Display Contrast slider
that lets you make text lighter and backgrounds darker. You can also
select Reduce Transparency to make it so items like the Dock and menu
bar are solid colors, rather than allowing the background to bleed
through. To separate dark and light further, select Increase Contrast,
which increases the brightness of divider lines as well.

### The Dark Side of Dark Mode
---
Contrast is necessary for pulling out fine details, but too much
contrast can be uncomfortable or even painful---think about how you feel
when someone turns on a bright light in a previously dark room. For
visual comfort, it's usually best to match your screen with the lighting
of your surroundings. That's why people who often work at night or with
the window blinds down like dark modes---a bright screen seems brighter
in a dimly lit room. That's the theory behind the traditional dark text
on a light background too, since the room will be quite light during the
day.

So Dark mode can run into two problems. First is that using it during
the day or in a brightly lit room may create an uncomfortable contrast
between the screen and its surroundings. Controlling your room lighting
can eliminate this as an issue. Second and more troubling, even apps
that support Dark mode may have large content areas that are bright
white, creating a strong contrast between the content area and the rest
of the app. Many Web sites in Safari have this effect, as do documents
in apps like Pages and Numbers. There's no way around this scenario.

Even if Dark mode isn't perfect, it's worth a try if you have trouble
looking at bright screens. Regardless, if it goes too far for you, one
of the new dark wallpapers may be easier on your eyes. While most people
aren't overly light sensitive, a non-trivial percentage of the
population is, particularly those who suffer from migraines or who have
endured concussions, and those with a variety of ocular conditions. And
if you're on the other end of the spectrum---if Dark mode looks dirty
and is hard to read---just stick with the traditional Light mode.

Do you like using full-screen mode on your new M1-based MacBook Pro but
hate having the menu bar disappear unless you move the pointer to the
top of the screen? Happily, in macOS 12 Monterey, Apple has at long last
added a setting to keep the menu bar visible at all times. Open System
Preferences > Dock & Menu Bar and uncheck "Automatically hide and show
the menu bar in full screen." The change won't affect apps currently in
full-screen mode until you toggle their window state again or quit and
relaunch. Unfortunately, some apps, including Apple's Photos, need to be
updated to show toolbars or other controls at the top of the window
without forcing you to mouse up there to reveal them.

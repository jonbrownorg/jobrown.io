Most of the time, when you unlock your iPhone or iPad, you want to
launch an app. In iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, you no longer have to unlock the
device, find the app on a Home screen page, and tap it. Instead, you can
open an app directly from the Lock screen, assuming Settings >
Face/Touch ID & Passcode > Today View and Search is turned on. Just
swipe down from the middle of the Lock screen ➊ to access the Search
screen, which lists apps from Siri Suggestions ➋. You can tap one of
those to open it, or you can use the Search field to find an app by name
and tap the search result ➌.

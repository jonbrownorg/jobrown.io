## Apple Provides Temporary iCloud Backup Space for New Device Transfers

When you move from an old iPhone or iPad to a new one, the easiest
approach is often the Quick Start device-to-device transfer. But if that
doesn't work, or if you have to give up one device before receiving the
other, iCloud Backup is a fine alternative. Fine, that is, if you have
enough iCloud storage space, which many people with the free 5 GB plan
do not. For devices running iOS 15 or iPadOS 15, Apple just introduced
the option to [create a temporary iCloud
backup]{.ul}](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT212732) that's larger
than the available space. Tap Settings > General > Transfer or Reset
*Device* > Get Started to create the backup. You have 21 days (plus
another 21 if necessary) to restore that backup, and it sticks around
for another 7 days after you restore.

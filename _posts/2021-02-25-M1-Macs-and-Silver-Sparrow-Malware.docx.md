Hot on the heels of the release of the new Apple Silicon architecture, a
new piece of malware for the Apple M1 processors was recently released.
The malware has been detected on almost 37,000 Macs with no evidence yet
of a harmful payload being found or determined. Security analysts have
not been able thus far to determine the author or the malware's
specifics motives only so far as a proof of concept.

There are two different types of this malware. One was built primarily
for the Intel-powered Macs while the other is compiled specifically for
Apple\'s new M1 chipset. Upon discovery of the malware, Apple has
retracted the certificates of the developer accounts used to sign the
packages to prevent further spread.

**How is the malware installed and delivered?**

-   The malware is installed via Apple installer packages (.pkg files)
    named update.pkg or updater.pkg. However, security researchers do
    not know how these files were specifically delivered to the user.

-   These .pkg files included JavaScript code, in such a way that the
    code would run at the very beginning before the installation has
    started. The user would then be asked if they want to allow a
    program to run "to determine if the software can be installed."

-   The malicious JavaScript code installs a launch agent plist file for
    the current user, which is designed to launch a script
    named verx.sh once per hour. This script has several functions:

    -   First, it will contact a command & control server formerly
        hosted on Amazon AWS.

    -   Next, the malware will check for the file \~/Library/.\_insu. It
        appears that this is a zero-byte file, and the malware simply
        uses it as a marker to indicate that it should delete itself. In
        this case, the script does exactly that, then exits.

    -   Finally, it will try to determine whether there is a newer
        version of the malware (which will always be the case if the
        final payload is not yet installed), and if so, it will download
        the payload from the URL provided in the downloadUrl parameter
        in the data from the command & control server. However, as can
        be seen from the data the download URL is blank.

    -   There have yet been any instances of this payload on any
        infected machines. If the payload were downloaded, it would be
        launched with the args data as the arguments.

-   Separate from the files dropped by the JavaScript, the .pkg file
    also installs an app into the Applications folder. This app is named
    either "tasker" or "updater," depending on the version of the .pkg
    file. Both apps appear to be very simplistic placeholder apps that
    don't do anything interesting.

So, if you do not have the malware infected on your machine already, you
do not need to worry about getting it as Apple has disabled the
propagation vector (thru signed certificates). If you have been infected
or want to determine if you have been, a tool has recently been released
on GitHub:

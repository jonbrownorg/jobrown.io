Thanks to [Apple's 2020 acquisition of weather company Dark
Sky](https://blog.darksky.net/), the iPhone's Weather app has learned
some new tricks in iOS 15. (It still isn't available on the iPad,
oddly.) Most obvious is its addition of weather maps that can show
precipitation, temperature, and air quality. More subtle are the
notifications that can alert you to incoming precipitation at your
precise location. To turn them on in Weather, tap the location button in
the lower-right corner of the screen, tap Turn On Notifications, and
agree to the necessary location and notification permissions when
prompted. (You can also do this later in Settings > Weather > Location
and Settings > Weather > Notifications.) From then on, whenever
Weather thinks precipitation is about to start or stop at any of your
preset locations, you'll get an alert. Some people find that Weather's
notifications aren't as frequent or accurate as those from other weather
apps like [CARROT Weather](https://www.meetcarrot.com/weather/), but
Apple will likely be improving the system.

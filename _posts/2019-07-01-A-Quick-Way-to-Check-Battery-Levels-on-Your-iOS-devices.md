Apple's Batteries widget is a little known but highly useful tool for
quickly assessing which of your small Apple devices is lowest on
power---something you may wish to do particularly when traveling with
only one charging cable. To access it, switch to Today view on the
iPhone, accessible by swiping right on the Home screen or Lock screen.
If the Batteries widget isn't already there, scroll to the bottom, tap
Edit, and tap the green + button to the left of Batteries in the list.
Of course, if you just want to check the battery status on one device,
that's possible too. It's easy to figure out how much power remains in
your iPhone's battery because of the indicator at the top right of the
screen (swipe down on it to invoke Control Center and see the percentage
on the iPhone X and later). On the Apple Watch, swipe up on the screen
to see its battery percentage in Control Center. For AirPods, open the
case and wait for the pop-up to appear on your iPhone's screen.

Last year, Apple started to transition Macs away from Intel processors
to its custom M1 system-on-a-chip. The M1's performance is stellar, but
Apple has used it only in low-end models so far: the MacBook Air,
13-inch MacBook Pro, Mac mini, and new 24-inch iMac. For professionals
looking for more power, Apple unveiled the future of high-end Macs at
its October 18th
[Unleashed](https://www.apple.com/apple-events/october-2021/)
event.

Two new chips---the M1 Pro and M1 Max---increase performance
significantly beyond the M1, and Apple built them into new 14-inch and
16-inch MacBook Pro models along with features that respond to
criticisms of previous models. Welcome as these new MacBook Pros are,
many people were also hoping to see an Apple silicon refresh of the
popular 27-inch iMac. That didn't happen, but Apple released several
other music-related products and services at the event.

### AirPods, HomePod mini, Apple Music, and Monterey Announcements

In a quick set of announcements at the start of its event, Apple
revealed an update to the popular AirPods, new colors of the HomePod
mini, and a budget pricing tier for Apple Music. Plus, press releases
revealed the ship date for macOS 12 Monterey.

-   **Third-generation AirPods:** Building on the success of the classic
    AirPods and AirPods Pro, Apple redesigned the [third-generation
    AirPods](https://www.apple.com/airpods-3rd-generation/) to
    have shorter mic stalks, force sensor controls, support for spatial
    audio, Adaptive EQ, longer battery life, wireless case charging, and
    sweat and water resistance. They cost $179; the second-generation
    AirPods remain available for $129.

-   **New HomePod mini colors:** Looking to coordinate your electronics
    with your decor? In November, the $99 [HomePod
    mini](https://www.apple.com/homepod-mini/) will be available
    in blue, orange, and yellow, as well as the traditional black and
    white.

-   **Apple Music Voice Plan:** A new $4.99-per-month [Apple Music
    Voice Plan](https://www.apple.com/apple-music/) reduces the
    cost of Apple Music for those who interact with the streaming
    service largely through Siri, but it lacks lyrics, music videos,
    spatial and lossless audio, and support for non-Apple devices.

-   **macOS 12 Monterey release date:** Hidden in the fine print in
    Apple's press releases was the fact that [macOS 12
    Monterey](https://www.apple.com/macos/monterey/)---along with
    iOS 15.1, iPadOS 15.1, watchOS 8.1, and tvOS 15.1---will become
    available on October 25th. We strongly recommend that you do not
    upgrade to Monterey until we give the go-ahead. If you've already
    upgraded to the other new operating systems, it should be safe to
    install those updates a week or two after release.

### New 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros Answer Customer Desires

Apple's professional [MacBook
Pro](https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/) has been a workhorse of
the Mac lineup for years, offering high-end performance in a portable
package. Since 2016, however, customers have expressed irritation at
Apple's removal of ports other than Thunderbolt 3, the loss of MagSafe
magnetic charging, and the Touch Bar replacing traditional F-keys.
Here's how the new MacBook Pros respond to those concerns.

-   **Ports:** Previously, the MacBook Pro had just four Thunderbolt 3
    ports, forcing users to carry dongles to connect to legacy devices.
    The new models still lack USB-A ports but supplement three
    Thunderbolt 4 ports with an HDMI port for video, an SDXC card slot
    for camera media, and a headphone jack.

-   **MagSafe:** Although you can charge using the Thunderbolt 4 ports,
    most people will rely on the dedicated MagSafe 3 charging port. The
    MacBook Pros (apart from the low-end 14-inch model) include powerful
    chargers and a USB-C to MagSafe 3 charging cable capable of
    fast-charging the devices. They should also provide longer battery
    life than previous models.

-   **F-keys with Touch ID:** The Touch Bar hasn't been a success, never
    migrating to any other Mac models and eliciting tepid support from
    developers. With these new MacBook Pros, Apple has reversed course,
    replacing the Touch Bar with traditional F-keys. A Touch ID sensor
    remains available for authentication at the top-right corner of the
    keyboard.

Although Apple did equip the 13-inch MacBook Pro with an M1 chip in
November 2020, it wasn't notably faster than the cheaper but largely
comparable M1-based MacBook Air. We suspect no one will be complaining
about the performance of the new 14-inch and 16-inch models thanks to
the addition of Apple's just-released M1 Pro and M1 Max chips.

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2021/20211019Ne/image7.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />

-   **M1:** For reference, last year's M1 chip---widely acclaimed for
    providing excellent performance---offers an 8-core CPU with four
    performance and four efficiency cores, a 7-core or 8-core GPU, and
    either 8 GB or 16 GB of unified memory.

-   **M1 Pro:** The M1 Pro offers up to 1.7 times the performance of the
    M1 thanks to a 10-core CPU that has eight performance and two
    efficiency cores. Plus, its 16-core GPU is up to twice as fast as
    the M1. The M1 Pro provides either 16 GB or 32 GB of unified memory,
    and it increases the memory bandwidth by nearly three times, up to
    200 gigabytes per second (GBps). To provide lower price points for
    14-inch MacBook Pro configurations, Apple offers versions of the M1
    Pro with an 8-core CPU (six performance and two efficiency cores) or
    a 14-core GPU.

-   **M1 Max:** The M1 Max has the same 10-core CPU as the M1 Pro but
    provides a massive 32-core GPU with up to four times the performance
    of the M1. The largest chip Apple has ever made, the M1 Max offers
    either 32 GB or 64 GB of memory, and it doubles the M1 Pro's memory
    bandwidth to 400 GBps, nearly six times faster than the M1. A
    lower-cost M1 Max configuration has a 24-core GPU.

Both the M1 Pro and M1 Max feature an Apple-designed media engine that
accelerates video processing while maximizing battery life. Both also
have dedicated acceleration for the ProRes professional video codec for
working with 4K and 8K video. The M1 Max doubles the M1 Pro's
performance for video encoding and provides two ProRes accelerators. In
other words, if you're working with video, these new Macs are going to
scream, particularly with an M1 Max.

Apple didn't stop after radically improving performance and bringing
back beloved features. The new MacBook Pros feature new Liquid Retina
XDR displays based on technology used in the latest iPad Pro models.

Most notably, for those who need more screen space than the 13-inch
MacBook Pro can provide, the new MacBook Pro models have higher
resolution displays. The 14-inch screen has a 3024-by-1964 native
resolution that's slightly larger than the previous 16-inch MacBook Pro
(3072‑by‑1920), and the new 16-inch model offers even more pixels with a
3456-by-2234 resolution. The new displays are more than twice as bright
as the previous models, and they support ProMotion, which adjusts the
screen refresh rate (and thus power consumption) to match the needs of
the onscreen content.

On the downside, Apple brought the new displays so close to the case
edges that the new 1080p FaceTime HD camera (better videoconferencing
quality but no Center Stage support) lives in an iPhone-like notch that
cuts the Mac menu bar in half. Full-screen apps can avoid the notch.
Although the notch isn't ideal, iPhone users seldom notice it after a
short while, and we expect the same will be true here.

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2021/20211019Ne/image8.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />

The only other negative for the new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro
models is weight. They're both about 0.4 pounds (0.18 kg) heavier than
the models they replace, at 3.5 pounds (1.6 kg) for the 14-inch model
and 4.7 or 4.8 pounds (2.1 or 2.2 kg) for the 16-inch model---the M1 Max
configurations are a bit heavier.

Despite the notch and the weight, these are impressive new entries in
the Mac lineup, and we anticipate they'll be well-received by users who
are happy to pay more for top-of-the-line machines. The 14-inch MacBook
Pro starts at $1999 and the 16-inch model at $2499. Numerous options
are available, so you can choose an M1 Pro or M1 Max for either size,
and pick from 16 GB, 32 GB, and 64 GB unified memory configurations.
When it comes to storage (which Apple says is also more than twice as
fast as previous SSDs), your choices are 512 GB, 1 TB, 2 TB, 4 TB, and 8
TB. Beware that the 8 TB SSD will cost you $2400.

We can't make informed recommendations about what options you should
choose until users start testing their real-world workflows against the
M1 Pro and M1 Max and see how much memory is really necessary. For now,
let your budget be your guide, and aim for an M1 Max if you work with
video. You can place orders with Apple now, but be warned that global
supply chain issues may mean waiting for some configurations.

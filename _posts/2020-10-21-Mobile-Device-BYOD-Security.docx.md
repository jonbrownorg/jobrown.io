The modern office, small and large, have largely driven the practice of
access to company data anywhere at any time.  With COVID-19 forcing many
companies to adopt a remote workforce, organizations must provide access
solutions to their workers in order to safely and efficiently perform
their tasks.  The cost to provide organization provided devices can be
expensive so the rise of BYOD (bring your own device) policies have
largely given rise to the concept of using employee-owned devices to
access organizational resources.  This reduces the cost of equipment and
reduces IT overhead by not having to purchase and configure mobile
devices for end-users.  However, using non-company owned or managed
devices to access company information introduces all sorts of security
risks and considerations. Allowing users to bring untrusted devices into
an organization and connect them to the company network can have a major
impact on the security of the corporate network.

So, what are the security considerations an organization should
implement or consider with a bring your own device policy? The easiest
and most applicable form of device security should be a mandatory device
passcode that is required for access.  A device passcode policy
complying with industry best practices including a complex passcode
should be enforced upon all devices within a BYOD environment to prevent
unauthorized access to the device.  Another consideration is the use of
containerization in the form of a second password used to access
corporate information.  A secondary password should be a different
password when the standard device unlock passcode with security features
ranging from device locking after three incorrect password attempts to a
serious security feature of completely wiping the device after an
incorrect number of attempts.  Another security consideration is a BYOD
permitted applications list for allowed or approved applications to be
installed on the device itself.  With so many potential rogue or malware
applications available on the various app stores it is important to
enforce only a handful of approved applications to execute on devices
that might have access to corporate data.  Finally, a BYOD security
policy should include also full-disk encryption as a mandatory
requirement to safeguard corporate data.

With so many of these complex BYOD security policy requirements, it is
recommended that organizations utilize a mobile device management
solution to track and manage enrolled devices.  MDM solutions support
many of the previously mentioned features but also ease overall device
management.  With an MDM solution, if a device is lost or stolen the
user can report it to the company and the company can have the device
remotely wiped thereby preventing corporate data from being accessed. 
An MDM solution also supports multifactor authentication which increases
the security over the standard device passcode which makes it more
complex in harder to access.  MDM solutions also support IP allow lists
to restrict access to certain IP addresses or ranges which prevents
anyone without a predetermined IP address from gaining access to the
MDM.

BYOD security policies and MDM solutions can be complex to undertake if
not properly analyzed and determined for your corporate requirements.

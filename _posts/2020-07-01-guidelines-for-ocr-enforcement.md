## What Is Telehealth?
---
The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) of the U.S.  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) defines telehealth as:

> The use of electronic information and telecommunications  technologies to support and promote long-distance clinical  health care, patient and professional health-related  education, and public health and health administration. Technologies include videoconferencing, the internet, store-  and-forward imaging, streaming media, and landline and  wireless communications.

The Office for Civil Rights (OCR)  has made it easier for all  covered healthcare providers to  participate in telehealth during  the COVID-19 nationwide public  health emergency. Their  notification states:

> The Office for Civil Rights  will not impose penalties for  noncompliance with HIPAA  Rules in connection with the  good faith provision of  telehealth using such non-  public facing audio or video  communication products.

IMPORTANT: Penalties will only  not be imposed for telehealth  related items. Penalties for non-  compliance with other sections  of the HIPAA regulations will  still apply!

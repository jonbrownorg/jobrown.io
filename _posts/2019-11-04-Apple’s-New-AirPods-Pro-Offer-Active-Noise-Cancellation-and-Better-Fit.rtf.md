Are you a fan of Apple's AirPods, or have you had trouble with them
staying in your ears? Either way, you might like the just-released
[AirPods Pro](https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/){:rel="nofollow"}, which offer a
new design with three sizes of soft, flexible, silicone ear tips and
welcome new capabilities. The ear tips should make the AirPods Pro fit
better for more people, and an Ear Tip Fit Test will tell you which size
is right for your ears. The hot new feature is Active Noise Cancellation
mode, which significantly cuts down on the background din of planes,
trains, and automobiles. Alternatively, Transparency mode reduces
surrounding noise while still letting you hear important announcements
and stay aware of the environment around you. And, of course, Apple
promises superior sound quality. The AirPods Pro cost \$249 and come
with a Wireless Charging Case.

At its September 10th special event, Apple unveiled a slew of new
products and services, including the iPhone 11, the Apple Watch Series
5, the seventh-generation iPad, Apple Arcade, and Apple TV+.

The company also said that iOS 13 and watchOS 6 would ship on September
19th, with iPadOS 13 appearing on September 30th and macOS 10.15
Catalina due sometime in October. Don't feel the need to update to iOS
13.0 right away, though, since Apple also said that iOS 13.1 would
arrive just 11 days later, on September 30th. It will contain some
features that the company had to pull from iOS 13.0. Other features will
continue to roll out throughout the coming months too.

### This iPhone Goes to 11

After several Roman numeral years starting with the iPhone X, Apple has
reverted to digits, introducing the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone
11 Pro Max. These are more significant updates than last year's models,
thanks largely to additional cameras, two for the iPhone 11 and three
for the Pro models.

The entry-level [iPhone
11](https://www.apple.com/iphone-11/){:rel="nofollow"} improves on its
iPhone XR predecessor with separate 12-megapixel Wide and Ultra Wide
cameras that let you take wider shots without resorting to panoramas.
iOS 13 uses computational photography with both cameras to enable the
new Night mode, which combines multiple exposures for astonishingly
better low-light photos.

The new front-facing TrueDepth camera is also now 12 megapixels, has a
wider field of view for selfies, and supports Smart HDR for more
natural-looking photos. It also now records 4K video at up to 60 frames
per second and 120 frames per second with slo-mo.

Like the iPhone XR, the iPhone 11 has a 6.1-inch Liquid Retina screen,
but it boasts increased performance with Apple's new A13 Bionic chip.
That makes Face ID up to 30% faster and lets it work better at varying
distances and at more angles. Although there's no 5G cellular support
yet, the iPhone 11 does offer Gigabit-class LTE and Wi-Fi 6. For those
who need multiple cellular plans simultaneously, it supports Dual SIM
with eSIM.

The iPhone 11 features a case made of aluminum and glass that Apple
claims is the toughest glass ever used in a smartphone. It can also
theoretically withstand dunking in up to 2 meters of water for up to 30
minutes---don't test that if you can avoid it. And the iPhone 11 comes
in six colors, with prices starting at \$699 for 64 GB of storage.

The [iPhone 11 Pro](https://www.apple.com/iphone-11-pro/){:rel="nofollow"}
and iPhone 11 Pro Max take photos and videos to the professional level,
supporting everything the iPhone 11 can do and adding a third Telephoto
camera. Each of the three 12-megapixel cameras can record 4K video with
extended dynamic range and cinematic video stabilization. You can switch
between the cameras smoothly while filming video. The presentation even
demoed a beta of the [FiLMiC
Pro](https://www.filmicpro.com/){:rel="nofollow"} app, which will let you
record separate video streams from each camera at the same time.

For still images, the triple-camera system adds a Telephoto mode to the
Wide and Ultra Wide modes in the iPhone 11, and iOS 13 utilizes all
three cameras and computational photography to deliver even better
results. For instance, Portrait mode can now switch between Wide and
Telephoto framing to provide a wider field of view that's great for
group portraits.

Although the screen sizes remain the same as in last year's iPhone XS
(5.8 inches) and iPhone XS Max (6.5 inches), the iPhone 11 Pro and
iPhone 11 Pro Max sport new Super Retina XDR OLED-based screens that
have significantly higher brightness and contrast specs. Physically, the
new models are just a hair---almost literally at about half a
millimeter---larger in every dimension than last year's iPhones. Battery
life is much better, with the iPhone 11 Pro lasting up to 4 hours longer
than the iPhone XS and the iPhone 11 Pro Max besting the iPhone XS Max
by up to 5 hours.

The iPhone 11 Pro models feature a stainless steel band and textured
matte glass back, and they can handle being submerged in up to 4 meters
of water for up to 30 minutes. We still don't recommend testing this.
Pricing with 64 GB of storage starts at \$999 for the iPhone 11 Pro and
\$1099 for the iPhone 11 Pro Max. They're available in four colors:
gold, space gray, silver, and the new midnight green.

All the iPhone 11 models become available for pre-order on Friday,
September 13th at 5 AM Pacific, and they'll ship to customers and stores
on September 20th. If you're not overwhelmed by the new features, or
just don't want to pay that much, the iPhone 8 and iPhone XR remain
available, starting at \$449 and \$599.

### Apple Watch Series 5 Is Always-On

With the new [Apple Watch Series
5](https://www.apple.com/watch/){:rel="nofollow"}, available for pre-order
now and shipping on September 20th, Apple addressed one of the most
common complaints about its wrist-based iPhone accessory. Now, instead
of going black whenever you lower your wrist, the Apple Watch Series 5's
screen will merely dim, brightening back up as soon as you raise your
wrist or tap the screen. That way you can read it without taking any
particular action or waiting for it to light up. This change involved
some impressive engineering since battery life remains at 18 hours in
typical usage.

Also new is a built-in compass that enables the Maps app to show which
direction you're facing to assist in getting started with navigation. It
also powers a new Compass app that shows heading, incline, latitude,
longitude, and current elevation, and the Workout app can report current
elevation and elevation gain. You can add one of three new compass
complications to some watch faces.

Finally, the Apple Watch Series 5 cellular models feature international
emergency calling. If you have an accident or get into trouble while
traveling, your watch can call the local emergency services via
Emergency SOS or through fall detection, regardless of where you
purchased the watch or even if you have a working cell plan.

The Apple Watch Series 5 is available in the traditional aluminum
(\$399) and stainless steel (\$699) cases. For more money, Apple has
introduced a new titanium case (\$799) and brought back the white
ceramic case (\$1299). If you don't need the ECG and fall detection
features that the Series 5 retains from the Series 4, the aluminum
Series 3 model remains available, starting at \$199.

### Seventh-Generation iPad Goes Semi-Pro

No one was expecting Apple to update its entry-level iPad, but the new
[seventh-generation
iPad](https://www.apple.com/ipad-10.2/){:rel="nofollow"} sweetens what is
already the best deal in the Apple universe. Starting at just \$329, the
new iPad increases the screen size to 10.2 inches, up from 9.7 inches,
and adds a Smart Connector that allows you to connect Apple's Smart
Keyboard to it. It's a few millimeters larger and a few grams heavier,
but nothing you'll notice.

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2019/20190913Th/image7.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="800" />

Otherwise, the seventh-generation iPad is
similar to the sixth-generation model, with an A10 Fusion chip,
8-megapixel 1080p rear camera, and 1.2-megapixel 720p front-facing
camera. It also supports the first-generation Apple Pencil for stylus
input. Battery life remains the same.

It's available for pre-order now and will ship on September 30th.

### Apple Arcade and Apple TV+ Details Revealed

We focus on Apple's computing and communications products and services,
which is why we haven't written much about the recent release of [Apple
Card](https://www.apple.com/apple-card/){:rel="nofollow"}, the company's new
credit card, which provides increased privacy protections and an
excellent interface, but no export options. Similarly, we don't expect
to say much in the future about [Apple
Arcade](https://www.apple.com/apple-arcade/){:rel="nofollow"}, which is
Apple's new game subscription service, or [Apple
TV+](https://www.apple.com/apple-tv-plus/){:rel="nofollow"}, the company's
slate of original video content, both of which were unveiled at Apple's
event.

For completeness, though, we should note that Apple Arcade will cost
\$4.99 per month when Apple launches it on September 19th. You'll get a
30-day free trial to see if a service that gives your family access to
over 100 games across all your Apple devices is compelling.

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2019/20190913Th/image8.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="800" />

Apple TV+ debuts on November 1st, and it too will cost \$4.99 per month
for access to all of Apple's original content. It doesn't include any
back catalog shows and movies such as are available from Netflix, Amazon
Prime, Hulu, and Disney+. A 7-day free trial will be available, but if
you buy a new iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac, or Apple TV, you'll get a
year for free.

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2019/20190913Th/image9.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="800" />

Phew! So many announcements! Our take is that the seventh-generation
iPad is a compelling buy for anyone who wants an iPad but doesn't need
the performance of the iPad Air and iPad Pro models. The always-on
screen of the Apple Watch Series 5 is welcome if you're in the market
for a new Apple Watch, though it may not be worth upgrading if you
already have a recent model. And the new iPhone 11 models look awfully
nice for anyone who takes photos and videos. And, let's face it, that's
most of us these days.

### Show Me Your ID!
Show me Your ID v 3.0 a great utility that allows you to as stated on the website "This [app](https://hcsonline.com/support/apps/show-me-your-id) will provide you with the Bundle ID, Team ID, and the full code for an application by dragging the application to the Show Me Your ID 3.0 window. You have the option of saving the applications logo to your Desktop. This can be helpful when configuring items in Jamf Self Service as it provides a look and feels similar to the Mac App Store."

I use this application often to get the Team ID and Bundle Identifiers of applications or installers for PPPC utilities. What else is it useful for? Well for starters when you drag an application onto the app it asks you if you want to extract the application icon. This is great for times when you want a copy of the app icon and you do not want to go into the App Resources folder. Why would you ever want to do this? 

Well as a Mac Admin you often have to build a catalog of applications in JAMF Self Service, Kandji Self Service, Addigy Self Service, Mosyle, or Munki, the list goes on and on.  One core feature of ALL of these systems is the ability to list the application and its Name, Description and application icon. Typically in these systems you have to upload the app icon and in most cases the Mac Admin is left to google and look for images of the app icon online but this great tool allows us to extract the actual app icon from the application directly so that we can upload it into the self service tool of our choice. 

This utility, written by Mac Admins, for Mac Admins gives you the right information just when you need it to streamline the process of building those App Catalogs with ease. Thank you HCS Technology Group!

Few people get so little email that they want an iPhone notification for
every message that rolls in. But many of us have just a couple of
people---our personal VIPs---whose messages are important enough to
warrant an alert. If that's true for you, and you want to know right
away when your boss or your spouse or your child sends you a message,
set up VIP Alerts. In Mail in iOS, in your Mailboxes list, tap the i
button next to the VIP mailbox. If necessary, use the Add VIP link to
pick your VIPs from your contacts, and then tap VIP Alerts to jump to
the screen of Settings \> Notifications \> Mail \> VIP. Once there, you
can choose a banner style, alert sound, and other notification-related
settings.

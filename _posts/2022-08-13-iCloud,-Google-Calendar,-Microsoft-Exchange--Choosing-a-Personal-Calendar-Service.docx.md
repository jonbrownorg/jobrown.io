We Mac, iPhone, and iPad users have an embarrassment of riches when it
comes to calendaring flexibility. Apple provides free calendar services
via iCloud, and the Calendar app lets you add calendar accounts from a
wide variety of providers. Most notable among them are Microsoft
Exchange and Google Calendar, which are commonly used in the business
world.

Since you can add multiple calendar accounts to the Calendar app,
there's no problem bringing your entire scheduling life together, even
if your work uses Exchange and your kid's school uses Google. But which
service should you use for your primary personal calendars, which you
likely need to share with your immediate family to ensure everyone is on
the same scheduling page? There's no one answer, but here's our take.

Start by considering the platforms used by the people with whom you
share calendars. Although it's easy to share iCloud calendars with other
Apple users, sharing an iCloud calendar outside the Apple ecosystem
requires making it a read-only public calendar, which may not be
appropriate for usability and privacy reasons. You can work around this
limitation in different ways, depending on the platforms in play:

-   **All Apple:** If you and your family all use Apple devices, the
    answer is easy---stick with iCloud calendars. You can easily invite
    people to your shared calendars, and everyone can both see and edit
    events on those calendars using a Mac, iPhone, or iPad.


-   **Apple and Google:** What if your child's only computing device is
    a school Chromebook or your spouse relies on an Android phone? In
    such a scenario, centralize your personal calendars on Google
    Calendar, where calendars can be shared read/write. If you don't
    already have a free Google account, make one, log in to Google
    Calendar, and create and share the calendars from there.


-   **Apple and Windows:** Perhaps a member of your family relies on a
    Windows laptop. If that person installs [iCloud for
    Windows](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204283), they can access
    iCloud calendars shared with their iCloud account. (Anyone can [sign
    up for a free iCloud
    account](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204316), even if they
    don't have an Apple device.)


-   **Apple, Google, and Windows:** Going for the trifecta, what if
    different members of your family rely on Apple devices, Android
    phones, and Windows PCs? The compromise option here is to fall back
    on Google Calendar, since both Apple devices and Windows PCs can
    access calendars shared from Google Calendar.

That's the overview. Briefly, here's how you share those calendars in
iCloud and Google Calendar.​

### Sharing to iCloud Calendars

To share an iCloud calendar, open the Calendar app on your Mac.
Control-click the calendar you want to share, and choose Share Calendar.
In the Share With field of the dialog that appears, start typing the
name of the person with whom you want to share, select their iCloud
account from the suggestions, and click Done to send the invite.

Subscribing to a shared iCloud calendar is usually just a matter of
clicking a link in an email, giving the calendar a name, and adding it
to your iCloud account. ​

### Sharing Google Calendars

To share a Google calendar, visit
[calendar.google.com](https://calendar.google.com/) in a Web browser.
Hover the pointer over a calendar name in the sidebar, click the stacked
dot button that appears, and choose Settings and Sharing. In the
Settings screen, scroll down to Share With Specific People, click Add
People, and enter enough of someone's name that you can select their
email address. Then adjust the permissions as desired.

There are too many variables to get into the details of subscribing to
shared calendars in [Google
Calendar](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37100?hl=en&ref_topic=10510447)
and [Microsoft
Outlook](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/see-your-google-calendar-in-outlook-c1dab514-0ad4-4811-824a-7d02c5e77126),
but check those links for advice on getting started. And of course, if
you're having trouble working your way through all the combinations of
sharing and subscribing, don't hesitate to give us a call.

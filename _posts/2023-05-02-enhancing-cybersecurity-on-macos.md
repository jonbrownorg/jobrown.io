Would almost seem like at some point if Apple really wanted to take their security game to the next level, they would almost be able to detect whether or not you were on a protected or unprotected network by running some sort of a network test based on where you are and what  you're connected  To maybe determine best guess, hey, the thing you're connected to does have a firewall. , And it's okay to not have firewall enabled or, Hey, I noticed that you're on like a public wifi. I'm going to proactively turn on the firewall for you. Sure, yeah. Yeah, that would be really cool. I would love to see Apple do something like that.

That's something that Joe's been talking about for years software that's more aware of environmental conditions and locations.

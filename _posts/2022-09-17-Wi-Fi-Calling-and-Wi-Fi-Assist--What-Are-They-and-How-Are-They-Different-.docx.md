Two similar-sounding iOS features generate quite a bit of confusion.
Wi-Fi Calling and Wi-Fi Assist both aim to improve your connectivity by
using the best network available, but they achieve that goal in
diametrically opposed ways. Wi-Fi Calling leverages your Wi-Fi
connectivity to replace weak or nonexistent cellular coverage, whereas
Wi-Fi Assist uses your cellular data connection when the Wi-Fi
connection is poor. Here's what you need to know.​

### Wi-Fi Calling

Of the two technologies, Wi-Fi Calling is more commonly used and more
helpful. It enables you to make or receive a phone call if you have a
Wi-Fi connection in an area with little or no cellular coverage. That's
a huge win---cellular coverage in cities often doesn't work below ground
and can be blocked by thick walls in old buildings too. And in rural
areas, weak coverage is a common problem. Your wireless carrier must
support Wi-Fi Calling for it to work, but most do---[check the full
list](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204039) for your carrier.

To enable Wi-Fi Calling, go to Settings > Phone > Wi-Fi Calling, and
enable the Wi-Fi Calling On This Phone switch. You'll likely need to
enter or confirm your address for emergency services. Normally when you
call emergency services, your iPhone provides the dispatcher with your
location based on cell tower triangulation; using Wi-Fi prevents that,
so the system falls back to your address. For this reason, the iPhone
tries to use the cellular network for emergency calls whenever possible.
When Wi-Fi Calling is active, you'll see "Wi-Fi" after the carrier name
in the status bar.

The other utility of Wi-Fi Calling is that it lets you take and make
phone calls on iPads and Macs that lack cellular capabilities, even when
your iPhone isn't nearby. It's a little more complicated to enable,
requiring the following settings:

-   In Settings > Phone > Wi-Fi Calling, turn on Add Wi-Fi Calling For
    Other Devices.
    
-   In Settings > Phone > Calls on Other Devices, turn on Allow Calls
    on Other Devices.

-   Still on that screen, turn on each device you want to use with Wi-Fi
    Calling. (Each device must be signed in to the same Apple ID.)

-   On your iPad or iPod touch, go to Settings > FaceTime and turn on
    Calls from iPhone. On your Mac, open the FaceTime app, choose
    FaceTime > Preferences, then enable Calls from iPhone and click
    Upgrade to Wi-Fi Calling. You'll need to approve the action or enter
    a code on the iPhone to confirm.

Once you have everything set up, calls should come through to all the
devices you've added, and you can start new calls from the FaceTime app
by entering a contact or phone number and using the phone button. The
only downside? Multiple nearby devices can announce incoming calls,
which may be annoying.​

### Wi-Fi Assist

Wi-Fi Assist solves a less common problem than Wi-Fi Calling, but it's
such a useful fix that Apple turns it on by default. In short, when you
have a poor Wi-Fi connection to the Internet, Wi-Fi Assist automatically
switches your connection to cellular. So, if a Web page doesn't load or
a search in Maps isn't getting results, Wi-Fi Assist kicks in to ensure
the task completes over your cellular connection.

The only downside to Wi-Fi Assist is that you could end up using more
cellular data than you expect. That's likely a problem only if your plan
provides extremely limited cellular data or charges significant amounts
for additional usage, as might be the case with a pre-paid SIM while
traveling. To ensure that doesn't happen, go to Settings > Cellular,
scroll all the way to the bottom, and turn Wi-Fi Assist off. (That
screen also tells you how much cellular data Wi-Fi Assist has used; even
when it's on, it's unlikely to consume much.)

There are a few caveats:

-   Wi-Fi Assist won't automatically switch to cellular if you're data
    roaming (using a carrier other than your main one for cellular
    data).

-   Wi-Fi Assist works only with foreground apps, not those that
    download in the background.

-   Wi-Fi Assist doesn't work with some apps that stream audio or video,
    or that download significant amounts of data.

In short, Wi-Fi Calling and Wi-Fi Assist are helpful features that
attempt to enable your iPhone to work normally for phone calls and
Internet-related tasks by switching between Wi-Fi and cellular as
necessary to ensure solid connectivity.

Of course, if you have neither cellular coverage nor Wi-Fi connectivity,
you're just stuck and will have to amuse yourself offline for a while!

So what right? Well this means Siri could always be on, and working seamlessly
inside the new iMac Pro.

This could make the iMac Pro the first Mac to feature an A series Microprocessor,
[which are the same chips found in iPhone’s](https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/931998054449893376).

"Looks like the iMac Pro's ARM coprocessor is arm64 Seems to handle the
macOS boot & security process, as expected; iMac Pro lets Apple experiment with
tighter control without the rest of the userbase freaking out. More info & download
[here](https://newosxbook.com/articles/BridgeOS.html)"

It’s exciting as the level of integration between Macs running macOS and iDevices
running iOS really will go to the next level.

In the office Siri with some dedicated hardware behind it could be a real boon to
productivity, imagine making a coffee and having Siri seamlessly read to you the next
article from Grove’s all via voice activated commands.

The A10 chip could also signal the new iMac Pro being always able to listen even
when turned off. No more reaching for the power button if Apple pulls this off.
Earlier in the year we announced the arrival of the iMac Pro; and with these new
promising features I can’t wait for the release of the new iMac Pro and the chance to
test one out.

In a move that should surprise no one, [Apple has discontinued macOS
Server](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208312), which started out as
a server-focused version of Mac OS X and eventually morphed into a set
of add-on network servers for macOS. Exactly what was in macOS Server
varied over time, but in 2018, Apple trimmed it to just Profile Manager,
Open Directory, and Xsan. That was made possible in part because Apple
integrated Caching Server, File Sharing Server, and Time Machine Server
into every installation of macOS 10.13 High Sierra and later. If you're
still using macOS Server, you can continue to download (look through
your purchases) and use the app with macOS 12 Monterey, but it's time to
start planning your migration since Apple says macOS Server won't work
at all in the next version of macOS. Contact us if you need advice on
the best way to proceed.

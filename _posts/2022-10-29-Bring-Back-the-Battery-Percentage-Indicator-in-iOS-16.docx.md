Back in 2017, when Apple added the notch to the iPhone X for Face ID,
the resulting loss of usable screen real estate caused the company to
remove the battery percentage indicator from the status area. Since
then, you've only been able to estimate how much battery life you had
left from the icon; you had to open Control Center to see the numeric
percentage. In iOS 16, however, Apple has revived the battery percentage
indicator for Face ID iPhones, building it into the battery icon itself
so it doesn't occupy more of the status bar. Unfortunately, it's not
available on the iPhone XR, iPhone 11, iPhone 12 mini, or iPhone 13
mini, perhaps due to a lack of sufficient screen resolution. Everyone
else can enable it in Settings > Battery.

Deleting contacts on the iPhone and iPad used to be a pain, especially
if you wanted to trash multiple contacts. You had to open the contact,
tap Edit, scroll to the bottom, and tap Delete Contact. Although you
still can't swipe left on a contact in a list, as you do when deleting
in Mail and Messages, iOS 16 and iPadOS 16 provide a simpler method.
Touch and hold a contact in the Phone or Contacts lists, and then tap
Delete Contact at the bottom.

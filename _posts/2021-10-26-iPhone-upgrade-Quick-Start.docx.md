## When Migrating to a New iPhone or iPad, Try Quick Start First 

You have a new iPhone or iPad---congratulations! When transferring your
data to the new device, you have three options: [Quick
Start](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210216), an [iCloud
backup](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204184), or a [Mac
backup](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204184). All will work,
but they don't quite provide the same end result (particularly if you
didn't encrypt your Mac backup). Our advice---backed by [this post from
Apple expert John
Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/24/how-to-set-up-a-new-iphone-or-ipad)---is
to try Quick Start first because it transfers everything directly from
your old device to your new one, maintaining app logins in most cases
and allowing you to transfer your Apple Watch pairing. It may seem like
it's taking a long time before you can use the device, but it's worth it
to avoid logging in to numerous apps and unpairing and repairing your
Apple Watch.

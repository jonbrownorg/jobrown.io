The iPhone has long been able to play clicking sounds when you tap the
keys on the virtual keyboard, but that feedback, while sometimes
welcome, can become annoying when you're trying to be quiet. A new
feature in iOS 16 provides haptic feedback---tiny taps you can feel in
your fingertips as you tap keys on the keyboard. It's a subtle but
highly effective way of mimicking a real keyboard, and we encourage you
to try it. Turn the feature on in Settings \> Sounds & Haptics \>
Keyboard Feedback. (While you're there, try turning off Sound; it may no
longer be necessary.)

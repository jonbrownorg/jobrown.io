I always seem to find myself either within a team or being the sole member of an IT department and really struggling to be able to take vacations. And when I was in that space as an employee managing Mac workstations for all of my users, but desperately trying to take time off I reached out to several consultants in the area and I was shocked to, to learn that there were very few sort of choices to pull from, and all of them did consulting, but not all of them did staff augmentation. 

So I saw a kind of a, an opportunity to leave my nine to five day job and at least try something new. I never felt like I was in a position where  I had ever struggled to find work. I think that I'm pretty fortunate in that case in the Washington DC metro area, I feel like there's more  Mac full-time positions than their technicians, which I think is why people who do consulting are flourishing pretty well in that environment than also people who are looking for full-time work are doing pretty well as well. So that's kinda where Grove Technologies started.

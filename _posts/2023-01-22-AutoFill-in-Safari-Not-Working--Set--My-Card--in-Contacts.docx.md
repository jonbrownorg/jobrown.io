We heard from a client that AutoFill in Safari suddenly stopped entering
her name and address in Web forms when she chose Edit \> AutoFill Form
or pressed Command-Shift-A, forcing her to enter her contact information
manually, like an animal. (And yes, the "Using information from my
contacts" checkbox was selected in Safari's AutoFill preferences.)
Although we have no idea what caused the problem, the solution turned
out to be simple. She went into Contacts, found her personal contact
card, and chose Card \> Make This My Card. Give this a try if you're
having trouble with AutoFill or haven't yet started using it in Safari.

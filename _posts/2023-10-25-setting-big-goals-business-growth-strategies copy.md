As a business owner I learned quickly that if you do not set big goals for yourself or your business you canâ€™t move forward. Grove Technologies between the years 2019-2022 grew 70% year over year and during that time we won 2 national awards, In 2020 we ranked #16 best MSP nationwide, and in 2022 #3 most up and coming MSP nationwide. The reason for this growth was our structured annual goal setting exercise that we ran annually. In addition each staff member created and set goals for themselves because the better we all are doing the easier it is for us to show overall growth and that incremental individual growth ladders up to massive organizational progress. 

Steve Garvey once said "You have to set goals that are almost out of reach. If you set a goal that is attainable without much work or thought, you are stuck with something below your true talent and potential."

Uncomfortable goals push entrepreneurs to think outside the box, explore new strategies, and overcome obstacles with determination. They drive individuals and teams to reach their full potential and continually strive for excellence. By setting uncomfortable goals, small businesses and startups can break free from their comfort zones, seize opportunities, and stand out in highly competitive markets. Furthermore, such goals encourage calculated risk-taking, allowing entrepreneurs to test their limits, learn from failures, and adapt swiftly to changing circumstances. Ultimately, embracing uncomfortable goals fuels a culture of continuous improvement, propelling business growth, and driving long-term success.

Implement the practice of setting stretch goals, which are ambitious targets that go beyond what may seem achievable at first glance. These goals require significant effort and innovation to accomplish. By setting stretch goals, you challenge yourself and your team to reach new heights, encouraging creativity and resourcefulness in finding novel solutions. These goals inspire a sense of urgency and a mindset of continuous improvement.

Utilize the SMART goal framework to set specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound goals. While uncomfortable goals are meant to push boundaries, it's important to ensure they are still within the realm of possibility. The SMART framework provides a structured approach that helps define clear objectives and establishes a roadmap for success. This approach encourages a balance between setting ambitious goals and maintaining a sense of practicality.

Establish a culture of regular goal review and adjustment. Set up periodic checkpoints to evaluate progress and reassess goals. This allows for flexibility and adaptability, ensuring that goals remain challenging and relevant as the business landscape evolves. By continuously reviewing and adjusting goals, you can maintain momentum and avoid complacency. It also provides an opportunity to celebrate successes, learn from setbacks, and pivot when necessary.

By employing these strategies and tactics, startups and small businesses can set uncomfortable goals that foster growth, innovation, and success. Remember, it's important to strike a balance between setting challenging goals and maintaining a realistic framework to ensure continued motivation and progress.

The comfort zone is a beautiful place, but nothing ever grows there. Set goals that scare you and excite you at the same time.

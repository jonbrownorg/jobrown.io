## The Best Apple-Related Gifts for 2021

It may seem early to start thinking about the holiday shopping season,
but with the global supply chain suffering pandemic-related slowdowns,
there's no telling how long it will take to get something you order
today. Apple has generally done a good job of managing its supply chain
issues, but even still, if you want to make sure you have an Apple
something for that special someone, we recommend buying it soon. Here
are our recommendations.

### AirTag

Do you know someone who's always misplacing their keys, purse, or
backpack? Apple's new [AirTag](https://www.apple.com/airtag/)
tracker is the perfect gift for such a person. Attach one to a keyring
(with a separate $29 [AirTag
Loop](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MLYY3ZM/A/airtag-loop-pink-citrus)
or $39 [AirTag Leather
Loop](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MM043ZM/A/airtag-leather-loop-baltic-blue))
or drop it in a bag, and from then on, the person can use the Find My
app to see where they left their stuff. Support for ultra-wideband
enables precision finding with an iPhone 11 or later---with earlier
iPhones, the detected location won't be quite so precise. AirTag uses
the Find My network, so even if the item is far away, passing Apple
devices that detect it can securely share its location with you. One
AirTag costs $29, or you can get a pack of four for $99. You can even
have Apple personalize each AirTag with custom text and emoji.

### AirPods and AirPods Pro

Apple's wireless earbuds remain popular, and the company just released
the [third-generation
AirPods](https://www.apple.com/airpods-3rd-generation/) to
supplement the [second-generation
AirPods](https://www.apple.com/airpods-2nd-generation/) and the
[AirPods Pro](https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/). All three make
excellent gifts. The second-generation AirPods cost $129, have a
relatively long stalk, and boast up to 5 hours of listening on one
charge. The $179 third-generation AirPods shrink the stalk, switch to a
force sensor for controls, add support for spatial audio with dynamic
head tracking, feature sweat and water resistance, have a MagSafe
wireless charging case, and last up to 6 hours on a single charge. For
$249, the AirPods Pro include the features of the third-generation
AirPods and add silicone ear tips and active noise cancellation with
optional transparency mode, but they have only 4.5 hours of listening
time. All three have charging cases, support Hey Siri commands, and
automatically switch between Apple devices.

### HomePod mini

Earlier this year, Apple discontinued the full-size HomePod, which
wasn't a big hit at its relatively high price of $299. However, the
$99 [HomePod mini](https://www.apple.com/homepod-mini/) remains
available, and Apple is now selling it in five colors, with blue,
orange, and yellow joining white and black. (The new colors will become
available at some point in November.) The grapefruit-sized HomePod mini
may be small, but it produces great sound for its size, and it can do
pretty much everything the larger HomePod could do. You can control it
entirely via Siri, pair two for stereo sound, use it as a hub for your
HomeKit home automation accessories, and even have it play the sound
from your Apple TV. Put a HomePod mini in different rooms in the house,
and you can use Intercom to communicate with family members using your
voice. If you're giving it as a gift, remember that it's best when
paired with an [Apple Music](https://www.apple.com/apple-music/)
subscription.

### iPad and iPad mini

If you're looking to give an iPad as a gift, you have a lot of choice.
The top-of-the-line [iPad Pro](https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/)
may be overkill for most given its power and price---$799 for the
11-inch model and $1099 for the 12.9-inch model. But the
fourth-generation [iPad Air](https://www.apple.com/ipad-air/),
which starts at $599, provides sufficient power for even the most
intensive tasks, especially when coupled with a second-generation
[Apple Pencil](https://www.apple.com/apple-pencil/) ($129) and
either a [Magic Keyboard](https://www.apple.com/ipad-keyboards/)
($299) or [Smart Keyboard
Folio](https://www.apple.com/ipad-keyboards/) ($179).

If those possibilities seem pricey for an iPad that's destined for a kid
or an adult with basic needs, look no further than the new
ninth-generation [iPad](https://www.apple.com/ipad-10.2/), which
remains a bargain at $329. It works with the first-generation [Apple
Pencil](https://www.apple.com/apple-pencil/) ($99), and those who
need to write can add the $159 [Smart
Keyboard](https://www.apple.com/ipad-keyboards/). Finally, don't
forget the sixth-generation [iPad
mini](https://www.apple.com/ipad-mini/), which benefited from a
major redesign back in September. It's now more like a diminutive
version of the iPad Air, with more colors and a squared-off industrial
design compatible with the second-generation Apple Pencil. It's $499,
and if you need a keyboard, you'll have to look to a third-party
manufacturer or use a standard Bluetooth wireless keyboard.

### Apple Watch Gift Certificate

Last but far from least, we love the [Apple
Watch](https://www.apple.com/watch/), and it would seem to make a
great gift. However, we urge caution. Apple provides a dizzying number
of options for case size, material, and color, plus the band and color,
making it difficult to know what would be most appreciated. So we'd
encourage giving a certificate that's good for a conversation about what
to purchase. Then sit down with the recipient to run through all the
decisions in the [Apple Watch
Studio](https://www.apple.com/shop/studio).

There are three options this year: the new [Apple Watch Series
7](https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-series-6/) (starting at
$399), last year's less expensive [Apple Watch
SE](https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-se/) (starting at $279), or
the much older [Apple Watch Series
3](https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-series-3/) (starting at
$199). Get the Series 7 if you want an Always-On Display, blood oxygen
sensor, and ECG capabilities---it also boasts a larger screen than last
year's Series 6 while remaining compatible with all the bands. The Apple
Watch SE lacks the Series 7's advanced sensors and has a slightly
smaller screen size, but it still provides the compass, altimeter, and
fall detection features. The screen on the Series 3 is smaller yet, and
it lacks a number of key features. Unless keeping the cost to a minimum
is essential, we have a hard time recommending the Series 3---it's
getting too old. Apple has a [helpful comparison
tool](https://www.apple.com/watch/compare/).

You may have noticed that we didn't include any Macs in this article.
They are worthy gifts, but they're quite a bit more expensive and more
difficult to select without extensive discussion of the recipient's
needs. Let us know if you need help choosing the right Mac for someone
on your list, but we're partial to the M1-based [MacBook
Air](https://www.apple.com/macbook-air/) and [24-inch
iMac](https://www.apple.com/imac-24/) for many users.

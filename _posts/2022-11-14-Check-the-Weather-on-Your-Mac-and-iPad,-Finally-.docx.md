At long last, Apple has plugged one of the most inexplicable holes in
its app library---the lack of a Weather app for the iPad and Mac. In
iPadOS 16 and macOS 13 Ventura, you'll now find a large-screen version
of the iPhone's iOS 16 Weather app. Locations you enter on one device
automatically sync to your other devices, and the feature set is
identical across the different platforms. That's especially welcome now
that Apple has integrated all the features of the acquired Dark Sky
service, including hyperlocal notifications of incoming weather,
next-hour and 12-hour animated forecast maps (tap the map), and
time-based graphs of temperature, UV index, wind, precipitation, "feels
like" temperature, humidity, visibility, and pressure. Plus, you'll find
cards for air quality and sunrise/sunset times. You no longer need to
look elsewhere on the iPad and Mac for a basic weather app!

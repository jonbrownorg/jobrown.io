Predictably ;-) Apple has released an iOS update to iOS 11.1.1 , this quickly follows on from iOS 11.1.

This latest iOS update fixes the keyboard bug that can cause the letter “I” to be mysteriously replaced with another character. See ([our previous blog]({{ site.site_cdn }}/blog/i-am-therfore-i-am/))

You can find the update in the Settings app in General > Software Updates.

We went over this bug last week, however there was another bug with Siri that we did not report on as we were unaware of the bug at the time of writing. 

iOS 11.1.1  fixes an issue with keyboard auto-correct , and also fixes an issue where Hey Siri stops working. [https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208067#1111](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208067#1111)

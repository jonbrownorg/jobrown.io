When Should You Upgrade to macOS 10.14 Mojave, iOS 12, watchOS 5, and tvOS 12?
---
It's that time of year again, when an Apple user's thoughts drift to new
versions of macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS. Apple announced the new
versions in June, and public betas have been available since. But once
Apple makes macOS 10.14 Mojave, iOS 12, watchOS 5, and tvOS 12 available
for free download, you'll need to decide when to install each.

(Note that we say *when* and not *if.* There's no harm in delaying major
operating system upgrades until Apple has had a chance to squash early
bugs. But waiting too long puts you at risk from security
vulnerabilities and prevents you from taking advantage of new features.
Plus, should you have to replace an Apple device unexpectedly, you will
likely have to use the current operating system, which could be awkward
if you weren't ready.)

The hardest upgrade decision comes with macOS 10.14 Mojave. Whereas the
last version of macOS---High Sierra---was a refinement upgrade that
added few new features, Mojave introduces lots. Some people's eyes will
appreciate Dark mode, and the Dynamic Desktop changes subtly throughout
the day. More practically, Stacks help organize files on cluttered
Desktops, the Finder's new Gallery view makes browsing images easier,
and Quick Actions in the Finder's Preview pane and in Quick Look let you
work on files without even opening them. Apple significantly enhanced
macOS's screenshot and screen recording capabilities as well. And apps
like Home, News, Stocks, and Voice Memos make the jump from iOS.

However, these features are bound to come with quirks and bugs, and
Mojave's new privacy and security controls may cause problems for older
software. So we recommend waiting until at least version 10.14.1 or even
10.14.2 before upgrading. That gives you time to make sure your key apps
are compatible with Mojave and for Apple to resolve any unanticipated
problems.

iOS 12 is a different story, particularly if you have an older iPhone or
iPad. That's because Apple has focused on improving performance for such
devices. If your device is bogging down, iOS 12 may give it a new lease
on life. Also compelling is Screen Time, which helps you track your
usage and set limits if you're unhappy about how much time you spend
giving Facebook your personal data. Screen Time even works for your
entire family, so it could make dinner less device-intensive. A
beefed-up Do Not Disturb lets you keep your iPhone from nagging you so
much, and new features let you tamp down excessive notifications more
easily. Finally, if you do the same things repeatedly, Siri Shortcuts
can help you create your own Siri voice commands.

Our take is that iOS 12 is a good upgrade. Don't pull the trigger
instantly, since Apple may discover important bugs in the first week or
two, but after that, upgrade when you have time to play with the new
features.

watchOS 5 is linked to iOS 12, so you can't upgrade your Apple Watch
until your iPhone is running the latest. Most of the changes revolve
around the Workouts app, with automatic detection of running workouts, a
new Yoga workout, activity competitions, and more. Other new features
include a Walkie-Talkie app, the arrival of Apple's Podcasts app, a
smarter Siri watch face, and improved notifications. There's no downside
to watchOS 5, so as soon as iOS 12 lands on your iPhone, set your Apple
Watch to upgrade that night.

tvOS 12 is the easiest to agree to install. It's a minor upgrade, with
just a few new features. The most noticeable is a new aerial screensaver
of Earth from low orbit, made by the crew of the International Space
Station. You can also tap the touchpad of the Siri Remote while an
aerial screensaver is playing to see where it was taken. When you start
trying to type a password on the Apple TV, a notification on your iPhone
lets you autofill that password. And finally, the Apple TV 4K gains
support for Dolby Atmos soundscapes. So yeah, install tvOS 12 when it
comes out, or let your Apple TV do it automatically.

As much as change can be hard, we're excited about Apple's new operating
systems. Like you, we probably won't end up using all the new features,
but some will enhance the experience of being an Apple user.

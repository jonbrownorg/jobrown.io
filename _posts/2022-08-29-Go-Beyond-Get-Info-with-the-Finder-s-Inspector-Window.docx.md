You probably know that selecting a file in the Finder and choosing File
> Get Info (Command-I) brings up the Get Info window. This window
provides information about the file, including its name, kind, size,
creation and modification dates, and much more. You can also use Get
Info to hide or show filename extensions, lock and unlock files, and
change permissions. But what if you want to do those things to multiple
files or figure out how large a set of files is? Turn to the Finder's
Inspector window instead. Select multiple files, hold down the Option
key, and choose File > Show Inspector (Command-Option-I). The Inspector
window looks and works almost exactly like the Get Info window. As a
bonus, if you leave the Inspector window open, it updates to reflect
whatever you select in the Finder---that's faster than opening Get Info
repeatedly for different items.

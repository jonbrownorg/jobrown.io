At the end of last week Apple’s support forum was lit up by users complaining of the letter “I” mysteriously being replaced with another character. This bug affected iPhone’s , iPad’s, and the iPod touch. 

If like myself your fingers are too large for the visual touch keyboard on iDevice’s already then this is another Typo hell waiting to happen.

Embarrassingly for Apple it also affects their flagship iPhone X, coming in at $999 it’s a bug you would not expect after buying such an expensive piece of tech. Interestingly the bug has not hit all users of iDevice’s and looks to be related with the emoji pack updates that came with iOS 11.

There is a work around to fix the issue, and it could also be dependent on user’s use of the keyboard and the syntax they use when typing. Make sure this bug is affecting your handset first as there is no point fixing something that is not already broken.

### The fix is
---
 - Go to Settings > General > Keyboard > Text Replacement.
 - Tap + .
 - For Phrase, type an upper-case "I". For Shortcut, type a lower-case "i."


H¿Æppy texting ;-)

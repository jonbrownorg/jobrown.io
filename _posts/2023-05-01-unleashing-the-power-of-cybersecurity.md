This is the part about security, I think that's really tough is the intersection between  the tools and the people. Because it's more about training good habits. Our tools right now don't enforce good habits.  

They  encourage it very gently  but  people have to really see the light on this and really try to like, take it upon themself and their responsibility to, to manage it.

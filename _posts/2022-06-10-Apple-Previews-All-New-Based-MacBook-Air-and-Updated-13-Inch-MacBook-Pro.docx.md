uring its [Worldwide Developer Conference
keynote](https://www.apple.com/apple-events/) on June 6th,
Apple took a brief break from showing off new features in upcoming
operating systems to throw back the curtains on its new M2 chip and a
pair of laptops that use it: an all-new MacBook Air and an updated
13-inch MacBook Pro. Apple said that both laptops will be available in
July.

### Next Generation M2 Chip Boosts Performance, Offers More Memory

Although we're still wrapping our heads around the insane performance
offered by a Mac Studio with the M1 Ultra chip, Apple is already
introducing the next generation of chips to power the Mac line,
beginning with the M2. It includes an 8-core CPU and 10-core GPU, and
builds on the capabilities of the M1, increasing CPU performance by 18%,
GPU performance by 35%, and Neural Engine performance by 40%. It also
offers up to 24 GB of unified memory (16 GB max in the M1) and expands
memory bandwidth by 50%. Impressive numbers, but still well under the
capabilities of the M1 Pro. We expect Apple to release an M2 Pro, M2
Max, and M2 Ultra within the next year or so.

### New MacBook Air Brings Complete Redesign

Apple claims the [MacBook
Air](https://www.apple.com/macbook-air-m2/) is the world's
best-selling laptop, which isn't surprising, given the model's svelte
size, zippy performance, and reasonable price point. For this revision,
Apple changed the previous wedge-shaped design to a squared-off look
that echoes recent Apple products like the 24-inch iMac and iPhone 13.
It's otherwise similar in size to the previous model, though just a
touch thinner and lighter. It's the same width and a bit deeper, likely
because it boasts a 13.6-inch screen and a full-height function key row
with Touch ID. Happily, it now charges using Apple's MagSafe 3
technology. You can get the new MacBook Air in four finishes: silver,
space gray, starlight, and midnight.

The new MacBook Air's screen isn't just bigger, it's also better. It has
a slightly higher resolution of 2560x1664, it's brighter, and it
supports up to 1 billion colors. In other words, it's gorgeous, and you
can supplement it with an external display up to 6K in resolution.
Embedded at the top of the screen is a better webcam with a 1080p
resolution instead of the previous 720p resolution. Apple also enhanced
its audio capabilities with a four-speaker sound system and a three-mic
array with directional beamforming.

The price of the M2-based MacBook Air starts at $1199, but additional
processing power, memory, and storage are available:

-   **Chip:** Choose from either an M2 with an 8-core CPU and 8-core GPU
    or one with an 8-core CPU and 10-core GPU ($100).

-   **Memory:** 8 GB of unified memory is standard, but you can opt for
    16 GB ($200) or 24 GB ($400).

-   **Storage:** The base level of SSD storage is 256 GB, with upgrades
    to 512 GB ($200), 1 TB ($400), or 2 TB ($800).

Like the previous M1-based MacBook Air, the new model sports two
Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports on the left side (next to the MagSafe port) and
a 3.5 mm headphone jack on the right side. It also supports Wi-Fi 6
wireless networking and Bluetooth 5.0.

It comes with a 30-watt USB-C power adapter, or you can pay $20 more
for either a 35-watt power adapter with two USB-C ports or a 67-watt
USB-C power adapter that supports the M2-based MacBook Air's fast
charging capabilities. If you opt for the higher-end M2 chip and at
least 512 GB of storage, you get one of the more-capable power adapters
for free.

Although the new MacBook Air is a little more expensive than a
comparably configured M1-based MacBook Air, it sports better
performance, more memory, a bigger and better screen, a better webcam, a
larger function key row, better speakers, and MagSafe 3. Nevertheless,
if you're working on a tight budget, the least expensive [M1-based
MacBook Air](https://www.apple.com/macbook-air-m1/) remains
available for $999, and it's still a fine machine.

In the end, it's hard to go wrong with the new M2-based MacBook Air when
upgrading from an Intel-based Mac laptop or supplementing your desktop
Mac with a laptop. It's small, light, powerful, and cost-effective, if
not a significant enough jump to warrant upgrading from an M1-based
MacBook Air.

### Updated 13-inch MacBook Pro Gains M2 Chip

While the new MacBook Air is a complete redesign, the updated [13-inch
MacBook Pro](https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro-13/) is
unchanged from its M1-based predecessor, apart from the move to the M2
chip. Since that's the same chip that's in the MacBook Air and the price
is identical for comparable configurations, the question becomes why
you'd buy the 13-inch MacBook Pro instead of the new MacBook Air.

On the plus side, the 13-inch MacBook Pro has cooling fans that enable
it to maintain peak performance for sustained loads---the fanless
MacBook Air will throttle itself to avoid overheating if you push it for
too long. The MacBook Pro's battery life is likely a little longer,
given that it has a large battery. Finally, it has a Touch Bar instead
of a function key row, which some may like.

However, the new MacBook Air's slightly larger screen supports more
colors (1 billion versus millions), and the MacBook Air has a better
webcam and potentially better speakers. It's also a little thinner and
lighter.

In balance, we recommend the MacBook Air unless you love the MacBook
Pro's Touch Bar, which seems to be on the way out. The 13-inch MacBook
Pro starts at $1299 for an 8-core CPU, 10-core GPU M2-based model with
8 GB of unified memory and 256 GB of SSD storage. The build-to-order
options are the same as for the MacBook Air.

Happy New Year! For many of us, the start of a new year is an
opportunity to reflect on fresh habits we'd like to adopt. Although we
certainly support any resolutions you may have made to get enough sleep,
eat healthy, and exercise, could we suggest a few more that will improve
your digital security?​

### Keep Your Devices Updated

One of the most important things you can do to protect your security is
to install new operating system updates and security updates soon after
Apple releases them. Although the details seldom make the news because
they're both highly specific and highly technical, you can get a sense
of how important security updates are by the fact that a typical update
addresses 20--40 vulnerabilities that Apple or outside researchers have
identified.

It's usually a good idea to wait a week or so after an update appears
before installing it, on the off chance that it has undesirable side
effects. Although such problems are uncommon, when they do happen, Apple
pulls the update quickly, fixes it, and releases it again, usually
within a few days. ​

### Use a Password Manager

We've been banging this drum for years. If you're still typing passwords
in by hand, or copying and pasting from a list you keep in a file,
please switch to a password manager like
[1Password](https://1password.com/) or
[LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/). Even Apple's
built-in [iCloud
Keychain](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204085) is
better than nothing. A password manager has five huge benefits:

**It generates strong passwords for you.** Password1234 can be
    > hacked in seconds.

**It stores your passwords securely.** An Excel file on your Desktop
    > is a recipe for disaster.

**It enters passwords for you.** Wouldn't that be easier than typing
    > them in manually?

**It audits existing accounts.** How many of your accounts use the
    > same password?

**It lets you access passwords on all your devices.** Finally, easy
    > login on your iPhone!

A bonus benefit for families is password sharing. It allows, for
example, a married couple to share essential passwords or for parents
and teens to share certain passwords.

In short, using a password manager is more secure, faster, easier, and
just all-around better. If you need help getting started, get in touch.​

### Beware of Phishing Email

Individuals and businesses alike frequently suffer from security lapses
caused by *phishing*, forged email that fools someone into revealing
login credentials, credit card numbers, or other sensitive information.
Although spam filters can catch many phishing attempts, it's up to you
to be on your guard at all times. Here's what to watch for:

Any email that tries to get you to reveal information, follow a
    > link, or sign a document

Messages from people you don't know, asking you to take an unusual
    > action

Direct email from a large company for whom you're an anonymous
    > customer

Forged email from a trusted source asking for sensitive information

All messages that contain numerous spelling and grammar mistakes​

When in doubt, don't follow the link or reply to the email. Instead,
contact the sender in some other way to see if the message is legit.​

### Avoid Sketchy Websites

We won't belabor this one, but suffice it to say that you're much more
likely to pick up malware from sites on the fringes of the Web or that
cater to the vices of society. To the extent that you can avoid sites
that provide pirated software, "adult" content, gambling opportunities,
or sales of illicit substances, the safer you'll be. That's not to say
that reputable sites haven't been hacked and used to distribute malware
too, but it's far less common.

If you are concerned after spending time in the darker corners of the
Web, download a free copy of
[Malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.com/) or [DetectX
Swift](https://sqwarq.com/detectx/) and scan for malware
manually.

### Never Respond to Unsolicited Calls or Texts

Although phishing happens mostly via email, scammers have also taken to
using phone calls and texts. Thanks to weaknesses in the telephone
system, such calls and texts can appear to come from well-known
companies, including Apple and Amazon. Even worse, with so much online
ordering happening, fake text messages pretending to help you track
packages are becoming more common.

For phone calls from companies, unless you're expecting a call back from
a support ticket you opened, don't answer. Let the call go to voicemail,
and if you feel it's important to respond, look up the company's phone
number elsewhere, and talk with someone at that number rather than one
provided by the voicemail.

For texts, avoid following links unless you recognize the sender and it
makes sense that you'd be receiving such a link. (For instance, Apple
can text delivery details related to your orders.) Regardless, never
enter login information at a site you've reached by following a link
because there's no way to know if it's real. Instead, if you want to
learn more, navigate manually to the company's site by entering its URL
yourself, then log in.

Let's raise a glass to staying safe online in 2021!

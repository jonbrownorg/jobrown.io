Cookies. Cakes. Pies. Brownies. All fantastic treats to have when you're
feeling down. But you know what the easiest and most satisfying dish to
make really is? Strong Cybersecurity! Let's quickly go over what you'll
need and the steps you'll need to take to have a truly cyber-safe
digital presence!

**Ingredients:**

-   Computer, laptop, tablet, phone, or some other device that connects
    to the Internet

-   1x Continuous Training Program

-   1x Password Manager

-   1x Multi-Factor Authentication

-   1x Dark Web Monitoring Service

-   1x Virtual Private Network (VPN)

-   1x Spam Filter

-   1x Data Breach Strategy

**Steps:**

-   Every week, make sure to watch your Weekly Micro-Training and take
    the quiz to keep the most current cybersecurity tips fresh in your
    mind. Also, make sure to take your Annual Cybersecurity Training for
    the same reason.

-   Make your passwords or passphrases extra-long, complex, and unique
    (NEVER repeat a password or it will ruin the dish). If you don't
    think you'll be able to remember all of them, use a password
    manager. That way, you'll only have to remember one master
    passphrase (make sure that one's a good one) and it will do the
    rest. It may even provide you with unique passwords.

-   Turn on Multi-Factor Authentication on all your accounts. This will
    force potential hackers to provide another form of identification
    (normally clicking a button on one of your devices or some form of
    biometric like a fingerprint) in order to access your accounts.

-   Pay attention to your Dark Web Monitoring. If you see that your
    password, username, or email has been found on the dark web, that
    means cybercriminals may try to use it to break into your accounts.
    Change them immediately! If you see that an unchangeable (or harder
    to change) piece of personally identifiable information (PII) like a
    phone number, address, or SSN has been found, contact the proper
    authorities.

-   Use a VPN (Virtual Private Network) when in public or at all times.
    Cybercriminals use public wi-fi to try to break into your devices
    and infect them with malware. Having a VPN on your devices will keep
    them from being able to do this.

We've become accustomed to our iPhones and iPads switching into Low
Power Mode to preserve battery life, and you can enable it manually if
you want to reduce power usage for a day. New in macOS 12 Monterey for
the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro is a similar feature, though you must
enable it manually. Open System Preferences > Battery, click Battery in
the sidebar, and select Low Power Mode. It reduces the screen brightness
automatically and may decrease CPU performance. Make sure to turn it off
once you don't need it anymore.

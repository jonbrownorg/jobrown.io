## Here's How to Hide All Windows on Your Mac So You Can Work on the Desktop
---

If your Mac is anything like ours, you end up with lots of apps open,
each with one or more windows that obscure the Desktop. For those people
who like to save in-progress documents to the Desktop and keep current
project folders there, all those windows get in the way. macOS has a
solution. Open System Preferences \> Mission Control, and in the
Keyboard and Mouse Shortcuts section, from the Show Desktop pop-up menu,
choose a keyboard shortcut. Try the right-hand modifier keys---we're
fond of Right Option---because they're easy to press and aren't likely
to be used for other purposes. Then, whenever you want to see and work
with the icons on your Desktop, hit that key, and do what you want. If
you like, you can press that key again to bring the windows back.

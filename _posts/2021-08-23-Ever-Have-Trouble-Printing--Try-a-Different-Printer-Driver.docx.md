Some clients have reported problems with HP laser printers failing to
print. Sometimes there's an error. Other times, the print job just
disappears into the ether. It's unclear why this is happening or how
widespread it is, but here's a workaround that can help. Create a new
printer configuration by clicking the + button in System Preferences \>
Printers & Scanners and selecting your printer in the list. Then, from
the Use pop-up menu, choose something other than the default Secure
AirPrint driver. We've had the most luck with Generic PostScript
Printer. Both the old and new configurations will be available when
printing, so if one doesn't work, try again with the other one.

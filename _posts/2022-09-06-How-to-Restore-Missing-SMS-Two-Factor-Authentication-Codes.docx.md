Many websites, from Adobe to Zendesk, let you receive two-factor
authentication codes via SMS text messages. That's good---any form of
two-factor authentication is better than none---but you're often
effectively locked out of your accounts if those text messages don't
arrive. A simple fix is to call your cellular carrier and ask to have
any blocks removed from your account. Automated scam and fraud
prevention systems may have installed those blocks---it wasn't
necessarily related to anything you did---and the carrier can remove
them easily.

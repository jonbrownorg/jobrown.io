We aren't quite ready to recommend that everyone upgrade to macOS 13
Ventura, but if you use Microsoft Office with macOS 10.15 Catalina, you
should start planning for an upgrade. [Microsoft has
announced](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/upgrade-macos-to-continue-receiving-microsoft-365-and-office-for-mac-updates-16b8414f-08ec-4b24-8c91-10a918f649f8?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us#ID0EBBF=Office_for_Mac_2019)
that current versions of its productivity suite---Office for Mac 2019,
Office for Mac 2021, and Microsoft 365---will receive updates only if
your Mac is running macOS 11 Big Sur, macOS 12 Monterey, or macOS 13
Ventura. If you keep using Catalina, your Office apps will continue to
work, but they won't receive enhancements, bug fixes, or security
updates past October's 16.66 updates. Contact us if you have questions
about appropriate upgrade paths.

Most of the time, having your iPhone know precisely where you are is
good. You want Maps to tell you exactly when to turn, not after you've
passed an intersection. But [too many apps abuse their users'
privacy](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/19/opinion/location-tracking-cell-phone.html).
We strongly encourage you to stop using such apps entirely, but we
acknowledge that it can be hard to give up apps that seem necessary for
modern life. Barring that, you could prevent such apps from seeing your
location at all, but even that isn't always feasible. Since iOS 14,
Apple has provided another compromise---you can prevent an app from
seeing your precise location while still giving it your approximate
whereabouts. Go to Settings \> Privacy \> Location Services, scroll down
and tap the app in question, and disable Precise Location.

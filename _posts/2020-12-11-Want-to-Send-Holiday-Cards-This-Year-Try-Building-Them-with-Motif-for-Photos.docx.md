In 2018, Apple dropped support for creating print projects from within
Photos, including greeting cards, calendars, and books. Instead, Apple
allowed other print-service companies to build Photos Project extensions
that gave users the same sort of capabilities. At first, they didn't
match up with what Apple had previously provided, but they've improved
over time.

It's the holiday card season again, and given how little we've all been
able to see friends and family, we expect a lot more people will be
sending cards this year. You're welcome to use [Mimeo
Photos](https://www.mimeophotos.com/),
[Shutterfly](https://www.shutterfly.com/), [Fujifilm Prints &
Gifts](https://pg-sg.fujifilm.com/), [Mpix](https://www.mpix.com/), or
[WhiteWall](https://www.whitewall.com/), but we're going to focus on
[Motif](https://www.motifphotos.com/), which generally performed well in
our testing.

To begin, [install the Motif
app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/motif-photobook-album-maker/id1404636482?mt=12)
from the Mac App Store, which also adds the Motif extension to System
Preferences > Extensions > Photos Projects. Once you have the
extension installed, here's what you do:

1.  **Select photos:** Although you can add photos to your card project
    at any time by dragging them into the project in the Photos sidebar,
    it's easiest to make a new album that contains a dozen or so of the
    best candidates for your card. If you don't already know exactly
    what you want, don't be picky at this point because it's easier to
    choose the final images from within the card layout.

1.  **Create the card:** With your new album selected, choose File >
    Create > Card > Motif. Then select either a 5x7 folded card or a
    4x6 flat double-sided card, in either portrait or landscape
    orientation.

2.  **Select a theme:** Motif provides various themes, and although it
    doesn't currently include any holiday themes for cards, they're all
    completely customizable. Since cards have relatively few images, we
    recommend clicking Don't Autoflow and placing images by hand. (For a
    book or a calendar, autoflow would be a boon.)

3.  **Choose layouts:** Although every card page starts with a default
    layout, you can customize every page in various ways. Would you
    prefer a single image on the front, rather than a multi-photo
    layout? Click the layout button below the
    page to open the Page Layout screen, click a number corresponding to
    how many images you want, and click the desired layout. (A bug in
    the current version prevents this from working on pages containing
    text blocks, but you can still tweak such pages---see the
    instructions below for adding, removing, resizing, and rearranging
    blocks.)

4.  **Add photos:** To add a photo to a blank spot on the card, drag it
    from the photo tray at the bottom of the window, which shows all the
    available images (scroll to the right to see all the photos if
    necessary). Dragging a photo on top of a placed image replaces it,
    pushing the previous one back into the image tray.

5.  **Add and edit text:** Themes come with pre-defined text blocks, but
    you can always add your own by clicking the Aa button under the
    page. You can tweak the font face, style, size, color, and more in
    the controls that appear whenever you select a text box.

Although that's the basics of what you need to know to create and
customize a card. Motif provides numerous other options that may prove
helpful:

-   **Move between pages:** Arrow buttons on the left and right side of
    the screen let you move between the pages of a card, but it's easier
    to press the left and right arrow keys. If you prefer to see all
    your pages at once, click the right side of the page button in the upper-right corner of the
    window.

<!-- -->

-   **Resize blocks:** You can resize any image or text block by
    clicking it and dragging its blue size handles. If the Magic Resize
     button in the top right of the window is
    selected, other blocks will resize to fit.

-   **Rearrange image blocks:** To move a block within a layout, click
    it, click the Move button in the control
    bar that appears, and then drag the block to a new location.
    <img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20201202Wa/image12.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />

-   **Add or delete a block:** You can add or delete an image block
    without going through the Page Layout screen. To add a block, drag
    an image from the tray to a blank spot in between other blocks. To
    remove a block, select it and click the trash icon in the control
    bar.

-   **Edit photos:** To edit a photo from within the project, select it
    and then double-click it again to open it in the regular Photos
    editing view. Other tools in the control bar let you zoom the image
    (drag the zoomed image to move it within the block), rotate the
    image, and change its opacity---for all three, adjust the changes
    with the slider underneath.

-   **Overlay text:** Once you've placed a text block on a page, resize
    or move it so it overlaps an image. If the text doesn't appear
    because it's underneath the image, choose Send Backward from the
    control bar's Arrange menu.

-   **Change page color:** In the Page Layout screen, find the Page
    Color button. Click it to change the color using the standard macOS
    color picker.

Some people may be able to create a card, drop a few photos in, change
the text, and be done in minutes. Others will want to tweak every last
detail to get things just so---if you're particular, you can probably
spend hours on it.

Either way, when you're done, it's time to place your order. You'll need
to create an account with Motif and run through a six-step process of
choosing the number of cards you want, providing your billing
information, picking shipping options, and entering your payment
details.

After that, it's merely a matter of waiting until they arrive and then
stuffing envelopes, addressing them, and popping them in a mailbox.

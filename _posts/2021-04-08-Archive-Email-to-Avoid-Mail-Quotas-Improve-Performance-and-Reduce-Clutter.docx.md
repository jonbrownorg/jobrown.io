Email is a major part of all our lives, both personally and
professionally, and as such, it can add up. Before you know it, you have
years of email stored away---potentially tens or even hundreds of
thousands of messages. Most of the time, that's fine. Email doesn't take
up any physical space and not even that much digital space in the scheme
of things.

However, there are situations where you might want to archive email, by
which we mean download it from the server and store it for posterity on
your Mac, possibly outside your email app. Some of those reasons
include:

-   **Insufficient server space:** Institutional email accounts
    sometimes have inflexible mail quotas, and although you can pay for
    more storage on many large email providers, you might prefer instead
    to clear out old mail that you don't refer to anymore.

-   **Reduce clutter:** Even if you have sufficient server space,
    archiving mail---particularly mail from ancient completed
    projects---might reduce the mental load of having it in your email
    app.

-   **Poor email client performance:** Although good email apps should
    be able to handle hundreds of thousands of messages, it's possible
    that reducing the amount of email in your account would help if
    you're experiencing slowdowns.

-   **Switching email providers:** If you choose to stop using a
    particular email account, you might want to download all the mail in
    it first.

-   **Leaving a job or graduating from school:** If you have a work or
    school email account that will be shut down after you leave, you
    might want to archive all that email beforehand.

-   **Preserving a former employee's business communications:** From the
    opposite perspective, if an employee of yours leaves, you might want
    to archive their work email account so you have an easily searched
    record of what they said to clients or suppliers.

-   **Local backup:** Although most email providers and businesses back
    up their servers (and probably better than most users), it's not
    inconceivable that you could lose mail stored remotely. Archiving
    email locally---perhaps on an annual basis---ensures the long-term
    preservation of your email communications.

So how should you archive your email? There are two general approaches:

-   **Store email in a local mailbox:** The most straightforward
    approach is to store email in a local mailbox on your Mac using your
    existing email app. It's free and keeps your mail together, but it
    makes switching to another email app more complicated, and it's
    fussy to move local mailboxes to other Macs. Plus, it may require
    some effort to keep an archive up to date.

-   **Archive email in a dedicated app:** You'll have to pay for an
    archiving app, but these apps work with multiple email apps, may
    provide more powerful searching capabilities, and often integrate
    email with other archived data. It's also easier to move archived
    data between Macs or even keep it available on a server for access
    on multiple machines.​

### Store Email in a Local Mailbox

For simple archiving, it's easy to create local copies of messages or
mailboxes you want to preserve locally. The main thing to keep in mind
here is the difference between *moving* and *copying*.

-   **Move:** When you *move* a message from the server to a local
    mailbox, you're deleting it from the server. Move messages when you
    want to clear space on the server.

-   **Copy:** When you *copy* a message, the original message stays on
    the server, and a copy appears in the local mailbox. Copy messages
    if you want a local backup of important messages or mailboxes but
    also want to keep them available online.

How you do this varies slightly by app, but let's look at Apple's
Mail---other apps will be similar. The first step is to create a local
mailbox. Choose Mailbox > New Mailbox and then choose On My Mac from
the Location pop-up menu when naming it.

Then, to move or copy mail:

-   **Move messages locally:** Select messages and, from the Message >
    Move To menu, choose the desired On My Mac mailbox. You can also
    Control-click a selection to access the Move To menu or drag the
    messages from a server-based mailbox to a mailbox under On My Mac.

-   **Copy messages locally:** Select messages and, from the Message >
    Copy To menu, choose the desired On My Mac mailbox. Alternatively,
    Control-click a selection to access the Copy To menu, or Option-drag
    the messages to an On My Mac mailbox. Also note that you can copy an
    entire mailbox by dragging it from an online account in Mail's
    sidebar to the On My Mac section of the sidebar.

You can also select a mailbox and choose Mailbox > Export Mailbox to
save all the data to a local file in .mbox format suitable for importing
into other email and archiving apps.​

### Archive Email in a Dedicated App

When it comes to archiving email in an app dedicated to that purpose,
the details vary, so let's focus on giving you some choices for the
leading Mac archiving apps. Once you know what you want, you can more
easily pick among them:

-   **[DEVONthink
    Pro](https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink) ($199):**
    The most powerful (and expensive) of these apps is undoubtedly
    DEVONthink Pro. It can import directly from Apple's Mail and
    Microsoft Outlook and supports importing .mbox files exported from
    other email apps. Its integration with Mail and Outlook lets you
    continually archive new messages without worrying about duplicates.
    DEVONthink is a general-purpose information management app that also
    lets you import, organize, and search for files of any kind, scan
    documents with optical character recognition, and much more. The
    $499 DEVONthink Server lets multiple people access the shared data
    over the Web.

-   **[EagleFiler](https://c-command.com/eaglefiler/) ($49.99):**
    Another general-purpose archiving app, EagleFiler supports direct
    imports from Mail and Outlook, and it can also import .mbox files
    exported from numerous other email apps. With Mail, EagleFiler can
    skip previously imported messages and includes an option to remove
    duplicate messages from mailboxes. It makes it easy to search
    archived email and lets you reply (using your standard email app) to
    archived messages. Beyond email, you can import, organize, search,
    and view any kind of file, and everything is stored in its original
    format in a standard Finder folder.

-   **[Mail Archiver X](https://www.mothsoftware.com/) ($49.95):** Mail
    Archiver X focuses on email, supporting major email clients like
    Mail, Outlook, Postbox, and Thunderbird along with .mbox files, and
    it can even archive email directly from your IMAP or Gmail account.
    You can set up Mail Archiver X to archive email on a schedule,
    automatically skipping previously archived messages. It lets you
    store messages in its internal database format, FileMaker (if you
    have a license), or PDF.

-   **[MailSteward](https://mailsteward.com/)
    ($24.95/$49.95/$99.95):** All the basics are here---support for
    Mail and Postbox plus .mbox files, scheduling of imports, importing
    into a relational database, automatic skipping of duplicates (and
    later identification of them if necessary). The three editions of
    MailSteward let you pick how much power you need. The Lite edition
    may be all most people need, but the standard edition adds automatic
    scheduling, saved searches, and database exporting and merging. The
    Pro version is necessary only for very large archives over 250,000
    messages---it trades MailSteward's SQLite database for MySQL.

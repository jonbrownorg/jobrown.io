In iOS 14 and iPadOS 14, Apple added two new status indicators to the
right side of the status bar at the top of the screen. They're designed
to give you feedback about what an app is doing. An orange dot indicates
that an app is using the microphone, and a green dot means that an app
is using the camera (and possibly the microphone as well). They're
subtle and shouldn't be distracting, but if you ever notice them when
you don't think the camera or microphone should be in use, look for apps
that might be using them in the background.

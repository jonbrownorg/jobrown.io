The iPhone and iPad have long allowed you to share Wi-Fi passwords with
other nearby devices and people as long as they were in your Contacts
list. But you couldn't see those passwords, which is handy for sharing
with non-Apple users and devices. In iOS 16 and iPadOS 16, you can now
view and copy the stored Wi-Fi password for either the current network
or any remembered network. In Settings \> Wi-Fi, next to a network's
name (tap Edit at the top right to view stored networks), tap the blue
information icon, tap Password, and authenticate to reveal the password.
If desired, tap Copy to copy to the clipboard for pasting in another
app, such as Mail or Messages.

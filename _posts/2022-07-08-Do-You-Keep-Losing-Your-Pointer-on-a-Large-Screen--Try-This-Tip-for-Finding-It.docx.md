A large screen---or several screens!---increases productivity by helping
you see more content at once. It's a big help to refer to a Web page in
one window while writing in another, for instance, or to check your
calendar while composing an email. But the more screen real estate you
have, the easier it is to lose track of the tiny pointer arrow. Happily,
Apple added a clever trick for finding the pointer to macOS---quickly
slide your finger or shake your mouse back and forth horizontally a few
times to enlarge the pointer briefly.

Apple's credit card, the [Apple
Card](https://www.apple.com/apple-card/){:rel="nofollow"}, offers a nice mix of
integration with Apple Pay, daily cash back, and an elegant interface in
the Wallet app on your iPhone. Until recently, however, it was
impossible to get your transaction data out of Wallet except in PDF
form. Apple has now added exports in either CSV or OFX format. CSV is
appropriate for importing into a spreadsheet, whereas many financial
apps can import OFX files. To export your data from Wallet, tap your
Apple Card and then tap Card Balance. Under Statements, tap the
statement you want to export, tap Export Transactions at the bottom, and
choose a format. For CSV, tap the Share icon in the file preview, and
for OFX, Wallet automatically opens a share sheet. Use AirDrop,
Messages, or Mail to send the file to your Mac, where you can work with
it in whatever you use to track your finances.

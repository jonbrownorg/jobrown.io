It's that time of year again. Apple CEO Tim Cook and numerous Apple
employees took the virtual stage again at the company's [Worldwide
Developer Conference
keynote](https://www.apple.com/apple-events/) on June 6th
to share what we can expect to see later this year in [macOS 13
Ventura](https://www.apple.com/macos/macos-ventura-preview/),
[iOS 16](https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-16-preview/),
[iPadOS
16](https://www.apple.com/ipados/ipados-16-preview/), and
[watchOS
9](https://www.apple.com/watchos/watchos-preview/). (Almost
no mention was made of tvOS or the HomePod, but Apple will undoubtedly
move them forward in small ways as well.)

The announcements came thick and fast, and like last year, many of the
technologies cut across several of Apple's operating systems. Before we
dive in, however, remember that some older devices won't be able to
upgrade. Here are the basic system requirements, though certain features
won't be available on all devices:

-   **macOS 13 Ventura:** iMac, iMac Pro, MacBook, and MacBook Pro from
    2017 and later. MacBook Air and Mac mini from 2018 and later. Mac
    Pro from 2019 and later. Mac Studio from 2022.

-   **iOS 16:** Second-generation iPhone SE, iPhone 8, and later

-   **iPadOS 16:** Fifth-generation iPad and later, fifth-generation
    iPad mini and later, third-generation iPad Air and later, and all
    iPad Pro models

-   **watchOS 9:** Apple Watch Series 4 and newer, including the Apple
    Watch SE

Here are the promised new features we think will have the most impact on
your Apple experience. Assume that these features are available on the
Mac, iPhone, and iPad unless otherwise specified.

### Customizable iPhone Lock Screen

We've been able to put a photo on the iPhone's Lock screen for years,
but that's it. With iOS 16, Apple is opening up lots of customization
options along the lines of what you can do to Apple Watch faces. To
start, you can customize the font, color, and placement of various
options, just like a watch face. Photos dynamically display in front of
the time, and you can have a set of photos shuffle throughout the day.
Widgets from Apple and third-party developers provide at-a-glance
information so you can check the weather, say, without even unlocking
your iPhone. Notifications now scroll up from the bottom, and Live
Activities help you stay up on the music that's currently playing or the
latest score in the big game.

### Messages Gains Editing, Undo Send, and Mark as Unread

At long last, Messages will let us edit messages after sending, undo
sending to call a message back, and mark messages as unread. The first
two features are essential for clear communication, especially when
you're fixing auto-correct failures, and being able to mark messages as
unread ensures that you won't forget to respond to something that you
read when you're not in a position to reply.

### Mail Adds Undo Send, Scheduled Send, Follow-up, and Remind Me

It's surprising that Apple hasn't spent more time on Mail in recent
years, but that's changing in 2022, when it will gain some welcome
features that are commonplace in other email apps. You'll be able to
undo sending, which is helpful when you remember something to add to a
message within 10 seconds after clicking the Send button. For more
specific timing, scheduled send lets you specify when a message should
go out. This is helpful when you are working on the weekend or late at
night but don't want your co-workers to feel that they need to reply
right away. Mail will also move sent messages that haven't received
replies to the top of your inbox so you can follow up, and you can set a
reminder to come back to messages that you've opened but not dealt with
(many of us just mark those as unread).

### Multi-Stop Routing in Maps

No longer are you limited to a single destination when creating a route
in Maps. You'll be able to specify up to 15 stops on a route, making it
easy to build a trip that includes a swing by your favorite diner, a
quick visit with an old friend, and a pilgrimage to the [World's
Largest
Bull](https://minivanadventures.com/united-states-roadside-attractions/)
in Iowa.

### iCloud Shared Photo Library Improves Family Photo Sharing

Apple's latest attempt to help families share photos looks like the best
yet---certainly better than the shared Family album that's created for
Family Sharing groups now. It will be a completely separate iCloud photo
library shared with up to five other people. You'll be able to populate
it with all your existing photos or a subset based on start date or
who's in them. Everyone will have equal permission to add, edit,
favorite, caption, and delete photos, so maintaining and improving it
becomes a group activity. Sharing new photos will be easy with a switch
in the Camera app, automatic sharing based on proximity to family
members, and sharing suggestions in Photos.

### Passkeys Aims to Replace Passwords... Eventually

Apple's new Passkeys technology, which is associated with the work of an
industry consortium called the [FIDO
Alliance](https://fidoalliance.org/) to ensure
cross-platform support, aims to replace passwords for websites and apps
with private passkeys that are stored only on your device and accessed
by Touch ID or Face ID. Passkeys are easier to use than passwords and
significantly safer because they can't be stolen from websites and each
one is specific to the site for which you create it. They'll be
available on all your Apple devices, syncing end-to-end encrypted
through iCloud Keychain.

### Use Your iPhone as a Webcam for Your Mac

Mac webcams are nowhere near as good as the rear-facing cameras in your
iPhone, so Apple is helping us improve our videoconferencing by using an
iPhone as a webcam and microphone. The feature, called Continuity
Camera, works wired or wirelessly and can automatically switch to using
your iPhone as a webcam when you bring it close to your Mac. It provides
Portrait mode to blur the background, Center Stage so you can move
around, Studio Light to dim the background and illuminate your face, and
even Desk View to show what's on your desk in front of your Mac. Apple
says Belkin will be making clips to attach your iPhone to your Mac.

### Stage Manager Offers New Window Management Approach

We're not yet sure what to make of Stage Manager, which is Apple's new
approach to window management on the iPad and Mac. It puts one app in
the center of the screen while keeping other apps off to the side,
making it easy to flip between apps or show multiple apps at once. It
doesn't replace traditional window management---you have to turn it on
in Control Center---so you won't be forced to change, but it might be
welcome, especially on the iPad, where it also enables the use of an
external display.

### Simultaneous Dictation, Touch Selection, and Keyboard Editing

On the iPhone and iPad, you've been able to tap a microphone button to
invoke Dictation, a huge boon when you want to send a message without
typing. In iOS 16 and iPadOS 16, Apple has radically improved Dictation,
so you can now simultaneously talk, type, edit on the keyboard, select
text via touch, and use the Apple Pencil (on an iPad). Dictation will
also automatically add commas, periods, and question marks as you
dictate, and you can insert emojis with voice commands. Sadly, it seems
that the Mac gets only the punctuation and emoji capabilities.

### Medications App on the Apple Watch

Many of us have to take medications, vitamins, and supplements
regularly. To help us better manage our health, Apple is adding the
Medications app to watchOS 9. You'll be able to enter your meds in the
Health app on the iPhone, be alerted to any critical interactions
between drugs, and have your Apple Watch notify you to take the right
pills at the right times.

### Weather App Appears on the iPad and Mac

Finally, because our list [goes to
11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xgx4k83zzc), Apple
says it's bringing the Weather app to the iPad and the Mac. Since
Weather has been on the iPhone since the beginning, it's hard to fathom
what took Apple so long. If you haven't already jumped ship for one of
the 17,000 other weather apps out there, you'll be able to enjoy using
Apple's built-in app in iPadOS 16 and macOS 13 Ventura.

Apple's upcoming operating system releases boast many other new
features, and we plan to explore more of them once everything ships in a
few months. We'll let you know when it's time to update!

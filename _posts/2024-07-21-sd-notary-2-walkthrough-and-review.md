### SD Notary 2
SD Notary 2 by Late Night Software developed by Shane Stanley is an amazing tool that has saved me hours in manual time notarizing applications, packages and DMG files and has been an essential part of my Mac Admin's toolkit.  [https://latenightsw.com/sd-notary-2-released/](https://latenightsw.com/sd-notary-2-released/)

The Mac Admins community is a really unique community. We're comprised of a great community of givers, and that was on full display at the 2024 Mac Admins Conference at Penn State University. It was at the Live recording of the Mac Admins Podcast when Tom Bridge said, "there is not a single person at the convention that is wanting any presenter at the conference to fail, so give it a try and don't be nervous"", it was that sentiment I think that summed up nicely what I feel the overall feeling of the entire emotion of the Mac Admins community is. Overall giving, warm, kind, generous and while not perfect sure there is some drama, yes we are human we are all trying just to help each other and these little amazing utilities on full display are a testament to that. 

You can see some amazing Mac Admins tools on full display here [https://github.com/smashism/awesome-macadmin-tools](Aweome Mac Admin Utilites) on a GitHub page curated by some Awesome Mac Admins, you can add your own contributions and I will add a video on how to do a pull request and add your own recommendations in a future blog post. 

SD Notary Tool is one of those timeless examples of a Mac Utility that has stood the test of time and I look forward to doing a pull request and adding it to this amazing list of tools very soon! Thank you very much [https://x.com/emilyooo](Emily Kausalik) for putting this all together and thanks once more for Shane Stanley for this amazing Mac Utility. 

I hope you enjoy my walkthrough of this great utility!

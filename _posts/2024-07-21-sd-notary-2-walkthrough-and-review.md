### SD Notary 2
SD Notary 2 by Late Night Software developed by Shane Stanley is an amazing tool that has saved me hours in manual time notarizing applications, packages and DMG files and has been an essential part of my Mac Admin's toolkit.  [https://latenightsw.com/sd-notary-2-released/](https://latenightsw.com/sd-notary-2-released/)

As we embark into this week of Mac Admins, at the Mac Admins conference I only thought it fitting to start getting more into highlighting some of the lesser known Mac utilities that I know and love and shouting out some of the lesser known contributors in the community that I really admire. 

Thank you Shane Stanley for an amazing utility!

Warnings abound of a major new piece of fraud doing the rounds
which [uses your relative's voice as part of a blackmail
scam](https://www.indy100.com/viral/warning-issued-major-scam). What
happens is the victim receives a call from said relative's number, and
they're cut off by blackmailers who have them held hostage. The only way
to get them back safely is to pay a sizable sum of money, usually within
a time limit. Refusal to pay up could clearly end very badly for the
person being held to ransom.

There's just one problem with this: It's all fake.

**When virtual kidnappers attack**

The tale is retold by a [Tik-Tok user who fell for the scam
tactic](https://www.tiktok.com/@citylivingsoutherngirl/video/7174452007476940075),
who says:

*\"New scam alert. I usually don't fall for scams but they got me.\"*

The victim recounts how she heard the voice of her mother "fading
away.\" This is supposed to sound like someone being dragged away from
the phone. At this point, a stranger jumps on the call demanding money
"or else." The scammer may be working alone, or have someone else doing
things like yelling in the background at the non-existent kidnap victim.
It's all designed to convince the victim to hand over a large amount of
cash in as short a time as possible.

In terms of demands, the pretend abductors demanded \$1,000 in US
dollars via Venmo or CashApp. The recipient of this call could only
afford to send \$100, at which point the callers ended the call. What
followed was an understandably panicked call to the victim's mother, who
was safe the whole time.

**Scams go around, come around**

This is clearly an unpleasant story, but let's take a deep breath before
we perhaps become a little too alarmed by references to newness and
(most importantly) claims of using your relative's voice.

First, this is not a new tactic. Not at all. These are usually referred
to as virtual kidnapping scams, and they've been around for some years
now. Here's an [FBI release regarding the targeting of
doctors](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/sanantonio/news/press-releases/virtual-kidnapping-extortion-calls-on-the-rise) back
in 2014.

In fact, we covered a virtual kidnapping threat around the same time
which [threw a few more scam tactics into the
mix](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2014/08/virtual-kidnapping-warning-doing-the-rounds-on-social-media).
In those attacks, a fraudster would: Pretend to be from a phone network,
and call the person intended to be the fake kidnap victim. The fake
phone network engineer would tell this person to turn the phone off for
a few hours. This was so they'd be able to call the other family member
they intended to extort, with no risk of them checking with the kidnapee
if they were in fact kidnapped or sitting at home.

**When fraudsters get vocal**

As for "using your relative's voice", well, no. Don't panic. People may
be inclined to start worrying about deepfaked voices winging their way
across the airwaves. In these cases, the victim is almost certainly
listening to generic voice recordings which very quickly fade out. The
relatives don't stay on the line, or make conversation, or say anything
beyond muffled screams after the call begins because they're not there.

The scammer is very unlikely to have anything sounding identical to your
supposedly kidnapped relative. It's the adrenaline shot of the call and
sheer panic [making people think that their relative is pleading down
the phone
line](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/07/chilling-extortion-scheme-convinces-victims-a-kidnapping-has-happened.html).
This, combined with the spoofed phone number, is enough to make it all
seem real while it's taking place.

**How to spot the signs of a virtual kidnapping scam**

There's a strong social engineering component to these attacks. Scammers
trawl websites, social media, and more, to obtain names of families and
individual family members. They do much the same thing for phone
numbers, which is how you end up with a call which looks like it's from
your relative and from their phone number. With this in mind, we have
some [tips and
suggestions](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2022/05/how-to-spot-the-signs-of-a-virtual-kidnap-scam) for
you:

-   Revisit your online presence, and lock down or delete as appropriate
    in relation to locations, names, and phone numbers.

-   Avoid posting travel dates and locations, which can add some fake
    legitimacy into a scammer's phone call.

-   Family members should have a password which allows you to confirm
    someone actually is in some kind of serious danger.

-   It used to be that these scams were almost exclusively steered
    towards wire transfers. As you can see from the above story, those
    payment requests are now moving into the realm of being fully
    digital.

There are [other tips
online](https://mocoshow.com/blog/beyond-moco-frederick-police-warns-community-of-virtual-kidnapping-ransom-scam/) sourced
from law enforcement, mostly in relation to asking to speak to your
supposedly kidnapped relative, trying to contact them by other means
while the scammers are on the line, and slowing the situation down to
allow you to try and contact the kidnapee in the first place.

Yes, this is an awful scam. However, it's definitely not new, people
only think their relative is being heard down the line, and there are
many strategies and safeguards in place to get one step ahead of the
virtual kidnap scammers.

Stay safe out there!

Starting with macOS 10.15.5 Catalina, Apple introduced a [battery
health management](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211094)
feature that improves your battery's lifespan by adjusting charging
patterns to reduce the rate at which the battery chemically ages. (Find
it in System Preferences > Energy Saver > Battery Health.) One thing
to be aware of with battery health management is that it might cause
your MacBook to display "Battery Is Not Charging" in the battery status
menu even when it's plugged in. That's normal, and it's nothing to worry
about. Of course, if you regularly see that message, it's a hint that
you may not be using [the proper power adapter and
cable](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201700) or that the power
source isn't delivering enough juice.

Sure, you know that the Space bar in the iOS virtual keyboard types a
space character. But did you realize that if you tap it twice, it
inserts a period? (Probably, but if not, now you do.) That's to make it
easier to provide proper punctuation, which will have the added benefit
of irritating your kids when you text them. Even better, if you touch
and hold the Space bar in iOS 12 or later, that invokes the trackpad
mode that lets you move the insertion point around in your text. It's
way easier than previous methods of navigating in text and makes it so
you can more easily edit what you write. Which, as a bonus, will also
bug your kids.

## Did You Know Your EarPods Work as a Remote Shutter Button for Photos?
---

Have you ever composed the perfect photo in the iPhone's Camera app and
then been unable to tap the shutter button without jiggling the iPhone
and blurring the image? That can be especially difficult with macro
shots that require physical contortions to position the iPhone properly.
Sometimes, pressing one of the physical volume buttons on the iPhone to
trigger the shutter is the solution. But, even better, connect your
iPhone's wired EarPods and then press one of their volume buttons to
take a photo. Bonus tip---the EarPods' buttons also work to start and
stop video recording!

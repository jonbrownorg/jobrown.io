## Teach Siri How to Pronounce Names Properly
---

Siri is supposed to be a competent voice assistant, but sometimes Siri
can't even pronounce your own name correctly! Luckily, it's easy to fix
Siri's pronunciation for any name. Just say to Siri, "Learn how to
pronounce Jill Kresock." (Siri defaults to "krehsock" rather than the
correct "kreesock" in this case.) Siri first asks you to say the
person's first name and then presents a list of options for the best
pronunciation. Tap the play button next to each option to hear it, and
tap Select for the one you like best. If none are good, tap Tell Siri
Again and say the name again, perhaps changing your enunciation
slightly. Once you've set up the first name, Siri will ask you to say
the person's last name, after which you can pick the best pronunciation
for the last name.

By default, most iPhones and iPads ship with Apple's tiny 5-watt power
adapters. They work, but not quickly. However, the iPhone 8 and later,
all models of the iPad Pro, and the most recent iPad Air and iPad mini
models support fast charging when connected to higher wattage power
adapters. You may have an older one of these around, or you can buy a
new one. Apple has bundled with iOS devices or sold 10-watt,
[12-watt](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MD836LL/A/apple-12w-usb-power-adapter){:rel="nofollow"}
($19), and
[18-watt](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MU7T2LL/A/18w-usb-c-power-adapter){:rel="nofollow"}
($29, USB-C) power adapters, and the company has also produced 29-watt,
[30-watt](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MR2A2LL/A/30w-usb-c-power-adapter){:rel="nofollow"}
($49),
[61-watt](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MRW22LL/A/61w-usb-c-power-adapter){:rel="nofollow"}
($69), and
[87-watt](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MNF82LL/A/87w-usb-c-power-adapter){:rel="nofollow"}
($79) USB-C power adapters for Mac laptops. Plug your compatible iPhone
or iPad into one of these chargers with an appropriate cable (for a
USB-C charger, you'll need a [USB-C to Lightning
Cable](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MQGJ2AM/A/usb-c-to-lightning-cable-1-m){:rel="nofollow"},
$19), and it will charge significantly more quickly. Look for a wattage
rating on the adapter itself, or multiply the output volts and amps
together to get watts.

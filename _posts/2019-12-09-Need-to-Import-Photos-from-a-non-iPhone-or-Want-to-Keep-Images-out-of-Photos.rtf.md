Most Mac users rely on iPhones and iPads to take photos and store them
in the Photos app, which happens automatically for those who use Apple's
iCloud Photos syncing service. But what if you want to import photos
from a device other than an iPhone or iPad---say a Samsung smartphone
running Android---and what if you don't want those images in Photos?
Turn to Apple's Image Capture app, which has shipped with macOS for ages
and is stored in your Applications folder's Utilities folder. To use it,
connect your device to your Mac via USB, launch Image Capture, and click
the device in the sidebar. Choose a destination from the Import To
pop-up menu, and then either select some photos and click Import or
click the Import All button to get everything.

Cybersecurity awareness to a certain degree, even at, even for home users.  We're talking about the popularization of broad-based tools like LifeLock, right? Which have capitalized on fear of losing your identity or actually having your identity stolen. As consultants, what is our  responsibility there?

Not just from the computer side of things and the technology side of things, but the awareness side of things, the social engineering side of things, the, Hey  this is phishing and beware of that type side of things. We've really started taking that very seriously.  I'm definitely seeing an increase in people, either their email being compromised or temporary browser hijack.

Lets talk a moment about the link between brand and business growth. The brand of your business is the face of your company, how it projects itself, and how its perceived in the marketplace. 

Building a strong brand, centered around trust and dependability is an important part of business growth. They go hand in hand. A strong brand not only helps established customers or clients become more loyal to you and your product or service offering but it allows you to garner new clients by that fandom and through the awareness that the brand brings to your company and its offerings. 

Choosing to focus on building your brand, and investing in marketing is a business building activity. I've heard it many times, a business owner says to me, I can't afford to invest in my brand, or marketing my company. I have to focus on sales, and I have no money in my advertising budget for marketing or brand awareness. 

In some cases the two become conflated. After all, isn't marketing your business, the same as advertising your business or a product?

According to Google "Marketing is the process of identifying customer needs and determining how best to meet those needs. In contrast, advertising is the exercise of promoting a company and its products or services through paid channels."

While branding is your identity, marketing are all the tactics and goals used to communicate that identity, build relationships with customers, and drive sales.

So if thats the case, if you are a business owner and operator and you jump right into product advertising, without first establishing a brand (your companies identity) you wont know how to tactilely enter the market, and if you are unaware of how to enter the market your ability to promote and or advertise becomes much harder, putting you in a position where you are ultimately setup for higher overall ad spends and much lower advertising effectiveness. 

Thats why I have long said, that building your brand, is building your company and investing in the overall success of your business. 

Steve Forbes said it best when he said "Your brand is the single most important investment you can make in your business." 

The link between brand and business growth is not just a connection; it's the very backbone of a thriving enterprise. Your brand is the heart and soul of your company, the essence that resonates with your audience, instills trust, and fosters enduring loyalty. 

Investing in your brand isn't an optional expense; it's an essential step towards long-term success. It's the foundation upon which meaningful relationships are built, both with existing customers who become staunch advocates and with new clients who are drawn in by your authenticity and credibility. 

Remember, building your brand isn't just about creating a logo or crafting a catchy tagline; it's about crafting an identity, embodying your values, and communicating your story in a way that genuinely resonates with people. By understanding the pivotal role your brand plays, you're not just investing in marketing; you're investing in the future, resilience, and prosperity of your business. 

So, take the time, put in the effort, and let your brand be the guiding light that leads your business to unparalleled heights of success.

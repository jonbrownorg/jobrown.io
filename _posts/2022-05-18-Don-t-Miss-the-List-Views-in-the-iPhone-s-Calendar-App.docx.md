The iPhone's Calendar app defaults to graphical views for Day, Week
(rotate to landscape), Month, and Year, but only the Day view shows
information about your actual events, and even then, it's easy to miss
events that are outside the times that fit onscreen. If you find those
views frustrating, you may have missed the all-important list view
options. In Month view, tap the List button ➊ to split the screen,
showing the calendar above and a list of events for the selected day
below. In Day view, tap the List button ➋ to switch to a more easily
scanned list for each day.

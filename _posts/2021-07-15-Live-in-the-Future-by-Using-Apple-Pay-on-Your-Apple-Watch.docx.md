With mask wearing over the past year rendering Face ID ineffective at
cash registers, we've become fond of using the Apple Watch for
contactless payments with Apple Pay. We recommend it highly since it's
so fast and convenient. Once you've set up a credit card in the Wallet
app on your iPhone, switch to the Watch app, go to My Watch \> Wallet &
Apple Pay, and tap the Add button next to the desired card. From then
on, to pay for a purchase, double-click the Apple Watch's side button
and put it very close to the reader. (We generally turn our arms so we
can put the Apple Watch face flat on the reader.) It takes just seconds
and tends to wow cashiers who haven't seen it before.

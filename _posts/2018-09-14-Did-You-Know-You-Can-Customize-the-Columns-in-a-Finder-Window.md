## Did You Know You Can Customize the Columns in a Finder Window's List View?
---

When a Mac folder contains a lot of files, the Finder's List view often
works best, since it lets you focus on a single folder and easily sort
the contents by clicking the different columns: Name, Date Modified,
Size, and Kind. But did you know that you can resize columns, rearrange
them, and even add and remove columns? To resize a column, drag the
vertical separator line to the right of its name. To move a column,
click and hold on its name, and then drag it to the desired position.
And to add or remove a column, Control- or right-click any column header
and select or deselect the desired column. Choose from Date Modified,
Date Created, Date Last Opened, Date Added, Size, Version, Kind,
Comments, and Tags.

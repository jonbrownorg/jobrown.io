Winter Wonderland may be a great song to listen to when the snow
flies, but if you're sweltering in summer heat, having it pop up while
iTunes is shuffling through your music feels wrong. Happily, there's a
way to prevent holiday music from playing out of season---this trick is
also useful for keeping children's songs from shuffling alongside tracks
from Abba, Beethoven, and The Clash. In iTunes, select the songs you
want to prevent from being included when you shuffle all tracks, and
choose Edit \> Get Info. In the Get Info dialog, switch to the Options
pane, select Skip When Shuffling, and click OK to save your changes.
Note that the easiest way to find such music may be by selecting Genres
in the sidebar and then Children's Music or Holiday in the list that
appears.

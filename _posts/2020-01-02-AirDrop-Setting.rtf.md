AirDrop has become a fast and reliable way to transfer data from one
iPhone to another that's nearby. Just tap the share icon and in iOS 13's
activity view, either tap an AirDrop shortcut in the top row or tap
AirDrop in the second row and select choose a person or device in the
subsequent AirDrop screen. But what if your iPhone doesn't appear for
the person who wants to share with you? Assuming Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are
both on, the fix is generally to go to Settings \> General \> AirDrop
and select Everyone. If you're concerned about unwanted transfers,
switch to Contacts Only afterward.

When you are starting as a consultant, you are everything. You are the one person that does everything. And then you realize pretty quickly, these are the things I don't like to do, and so maybe I should partner with somebody who can help me be a better CEO. Or maybe I shouldn't be a CEO. Maybe the company would be better off with me, not in that role.

And if I merge with this other company, or if we have these conversations with other companies in our, within our space, then maybe we can partner together and mutually benefit each other and get to a larger playing field so that we can provide more support. Better Mac support to more people.

Yeah. It seems like a, the more self-reflection that goes in, throughout the course of just, running your business the more, the more potential opportunities you, you can potentially, capitalize on because it's, it's like the more you reflect on what are the things I don't want to do?

What are the things I'm best at or worst at? You can begin to see like how you might mesh with another company. And it's hard to even really have those kinds of reflections with, without getting to that point. It sounds like, you've, you were pretty far along in the process a few times and it caused you to that kind of reckoning in a very real way. And I think that, you can learn a lot from just going through that kind of scenario. And I think, you've shared a lot of. Great information that I think will help a lot of our listeners do some of that self-reflection to see the point that they can get to it.

It's funny cuz we've talked about how being a person who wants to retain some amount of control over the way things are done and, sometimes I think about why do I want it done that way? Maybe I don't know offhand. As soon as you hand off the reins to someone and they say, I'm gonna do it better this other way, and then you realize, oh, that's why I realized how important it was to do it the other way because it had this other outcome or this other side benefit that I didn't really pay close attention to.

It just speaks to the difficulty of sometimes giving up control and at the same time I find myself reflecting sometimes, Man wouldn't it be so much easier just to be a tech? I wish this was all I did all day was like talking the phone to people and just solve their problems. That would be desirable if I were to be bought out.

I could see myself just purely being a consultant for a while once again. So it's, yeah. I could see it really on both sides. It's a complex kind of yeah. Thing to go.

The next time you buy and set up a new Mac, make sure to migrate data
and apps from your previous Mac to it right away during the initial
setup. It can be tempting to see what it's like to use it fresh from the
factory or to delay migrating because doing so would force a macOS
upgrade, but waiting is a mistake. The problem is that if you do real
work in an account on the new Mac, when it comes time to use Migration
Assistant to bring over data from your old Mac, there's no way to merge
the old and new accounts. The best workaround is to make sure all
important data on the new Mac is also stored in a cloud service like
iCloud Drive or Dropbox, and then replace the new account on the new Mac
with the old account from your previous Mac. Bring all the data back
down from the cloud afterward.

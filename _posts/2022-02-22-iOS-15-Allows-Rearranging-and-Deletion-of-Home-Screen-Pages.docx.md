Back in iOS 14, Apple added the App Library, which collects all the apps
on your iPhone. With everything available in the App Library, iOS 14 was
also able to provide the option of hiding Home screen pages, a boon for
those of us with too many disorganized pages. In iOS 15, Apple has taken
the next step. You can still hide Home screen pages, but if you never
want to see them again, you can delete them (apps remain in the App
Library). Or, if they're not in the order you want, you can rearrange
them. Touch and hold any empty spot on the Home screen to enter jiggle
mode. Tap the dots above the Dock that indicate which Home screen page
you're on. In the Edit Pages screen, you can now tap the -- button next
to a hidden page to delete it ➊. If you want to delete a visible page,
first hide it by tapping its checkmark underneath ➋. Or, to rearrange
Home screen pages, drag a thumbnail to a new location ➌. Tap Done or
press the Home button when you're finished.

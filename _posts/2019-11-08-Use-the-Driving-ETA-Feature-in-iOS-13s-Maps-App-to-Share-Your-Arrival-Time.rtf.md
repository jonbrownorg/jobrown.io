A small but welcome new feature of iOS 13 is Driving ETA, which helps
you share your estimated time of arrival with a contact whenever you're
navigating with the Maps app. To use Driving ETA, start navigating to a
destination in Maps, tap Share ETA at the bottom of the screen, and pick
the person with whom you want to share your location and arrival time.
(You'll share in Maps with iOS 13 users and via Messages with everyone
else.) The other person will receive a notification of your ETA and if
you're delayed, updated times. You do have to start navigation in Maps
to use Driving ETA, so it's a little inconvenient when you already know
the route, but it's a brilliant feature for long-distance trips.

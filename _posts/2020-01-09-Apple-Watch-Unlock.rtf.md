If you've resisted requiring a password on your Mac after it wakes up or
comes out of the screen saver because it's too much work to enter
repeatedly, an Apple Watch can make authentication much easier. In
previous versions of macOS, just wearing an unlocked Apple Watch is
enough to enter your Mac's password; in Catalina, the Apple Watch can
also enter your password when prompted by apps. First, make sure your
Apple Watch has a passcode (in Watch \> Passcode), is on your wrist, and
is unlocked. Then, in System Preferences \> Security & Privacy \>
General, select "Use your Apple Watch to unlock apps and your Mac." From
then on, most of the time your Mac or an app wants your password, your
Apple Watch will provide it automatically. (This feature requires that
the Mac dates from mid-2013 or later, that all devices use the same
iCloud account, and that the Apple ID uses two-factor authentication
instead of two-step verification.)

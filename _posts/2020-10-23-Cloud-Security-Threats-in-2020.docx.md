Cloud computing has taken the technology industry by storm in recent
years, providing businesses small and large alike with convenient and
cost-efficient solutions to store and share data. Platforms such as
Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure provide web hosting for
some of the largest and most popular websites on the internet. Cloud
Solutions are attractive options for small business owners, as they
eliminate the need for spacious and expensive data warehouses and
provide for fast and easy scalability. However, these new and evolving
benefits are accompanied by an assortment of new security threats. Some
of the most common threats to cloud security are improper access
management practices, data breaches, insecure APIs, and misconfigured
storage. To best protect themselves, small businesses must be aware of
these threats as well as best practices for prevention.

Improper Access Management practices pose great security risk to
companies in the cloud. Much like when storing sensitive data on
premise, companies storing their data in the cloud must allow employees
to access certain information while denying them access to other
information. AWS, for instance, allows administrators to create identity
access management users (IAM users) and assign certain permissions to
each user. When setting these permissions, best practice is to give
users the minimum access necessary to fulfill their roles in the
company. In this way, companies reduce the amount of exposure if an
account is hacked. Multi-factor authentication adds an extra layer of
security, as a hacker would need both the password and a chosen piece of
hardware, such as a smartphone, to gain access to the account. Cloud
security can only be achieved when unauthorized users are unable to
access data.

A Data Breach is an incident wherein an unauthorized individual gains
access to a company's data through exploiting holes in security or by
manipulating individuals within the company. This can have huge
financial and legal ramifications for the company. To prevent a data
breach, companies and users with access must use MFA and never share
their passwords. Firewalls must be used at multiple levels to limit
inbound and outbound traffic to web servers and databases. Firewalls
must be continuously updated, and passwords continuously changed in
order to maintain proper security in the cloud.

The Application User Interface (API) is a common point of vulnerability
because it is the main way the system is accessed both internally (by
employees) and externally (by consumers). Being open to the public makes
the API a critical point to consider when analyzing security risk. Using
strong passwords and encrypting data are simple measures businesses can
take to secure their APIs. Close monitoring and frequent updates to API
security are integral to protecting data in a cloud environment.

Misconfigured Storage is a common source of leaked data. Businesses use
cloud storage resources such as Amazon S3 to store information. When not
configured correctly, these resources lack proper security measures to
limit access. Correct configuration includes proper assignment of user
permissions in addition to adjusting the default security settings to
satisfy needs. Without sufficient access-limiting protocols,
cloud-stored data is open to attack from the outside. As the state of
cloud computing evolves, companies must constantly assess their security
policies and update as needed to protect from new threats and points of
vulnerability.

Understanding each of these threats and having measures in place to
prevent them are critical to your security in the cloud. Navigating the
intricacies of cloud computing can be a daunting task, but you don't
have to do it alone! Our experts at Grove are waiting to help you
implement proper security in the cloud. Call one of our consultants now!

Home screen widgets are one of the coolest features of iOS 14. They
enable apps to offer quick access to features or at-a-glance previews of
changing information, such as the Weather app's widget providing a quick
look at upcoming weather. What you may not realize, however, is that an
app's widgets become available for adding to your Home screen only if
you have launched the app since upgrading to iOS 14. (To see the list,
press and hold on an empty part of the Home screen and then tap the +
button in a top corner.) For instance, if you haven't traveled since the
pandemic started, you might not realize that the Kayak app has a handy
price alert widget. Just launch the app once, and you'll see its widgets
the next time you look through the complete widget list.

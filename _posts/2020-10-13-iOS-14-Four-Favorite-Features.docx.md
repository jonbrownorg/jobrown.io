Our Four Favorite Features of iOS 14
------------------------------------

Harvest season is here again, and Apple has deemed [iOS
14](https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-14/) (along with iPadOS
14, watchOS 7, and tvOS 14) ready for the picking. Although the betas
have been pretty stable and no major problems have appeared in the first
few days, we still recommend waiting at least a few weeks before
installing via Settings > General > Software Update. In large part,
that's because many developers were taken by surprise by Apple's
release, so they're working hard to release updates that work properly
with iOS 14 and take advantage of its new features.

When you decide to take the leap and install---be sure to make a backup
first, just in case---here are four features we recommend you check out
right away.

### App Library

If you're like us, your first Home screen or two are well-organized, and
after that...where did all those apps come from? We find ourselves
searching for little-used apps (swipe down on a Home screen) but wish we
could see a list of all installed apps. With iOS 14's new App Library,
we can.

A new screen to the right of your last Home screen, the App Library
collects all your apps into folders. At the top, Suggestions includes
four suggested apps based on time, location, or activity, and Recently
Added shows the apps you've downloaded lately. The rest of the folders,
which, unfortunately, you can't rename or rearrange, organize apps by
category. In a folder grid, tapping a large icon opens that app, while
tapping the group of four small icons in the lower-right corner opens
the folder. To see an alphabetical list of every app, tap the search
field at the top. You can type to narrow the list.

The App Library is tremendously useful because it contains every app and
is always in the same place. That enables you to more easily find apps
that you've removed from your Home screen. It also works well if you
choose to hide entire Home screens, another new iOS 14 feature. Note
that you can copy apps from the App Library to a Home screen, which can
aid in creating your own organizational scheme.

You might even find that you like having just a couple of Home screens
and leaving everything else in the App Library.

### Home Screen Widgets

Nothing prevents you from whittling your set of Home screens down to
just one, but another new iOS 14 feature might encourage you to have a
few more. For some years now, apps have had *widgets.* Widgets are
little summary interfaces accessible in Today View, which you access by
swiping right on the first Home screen. In iOS 14, you can now place
some of those widgets directly on a Home screen.

Widgets come in three sizes: a small square that occupies the space of
four normal app icons, a horizontal rectangle that's the size of two
rows of apps, and a large square that takes up the space of four rows of
apps.

To add a widget, touch and hold any empty spot on a Home screen, tap the
+ button in the upper-left corner, and drag the desired widget out to
the Home screen, where you can continue to drag it to your desired
position. When viewing the widget collection, tap a widget to see all
its available sizes.

Right now, most widgets are from Apple apps, but we anticipate many
developers adding widgets for their apps in the coming months. You can
have as many widgets on a Home screen as will fit, and there's no
problem mixing widgets and apps within the available space. Think about
what information you like to get from your iPhone, and then go nuts
creating custom Home screens that show what you want at a glance.

### Shrunken Siri and Phone Call Interfaces

In previous versions of iOS, when you invoked Siri, the interface
completely took over the iPhone screen. It turns out there was no need
for that, so in iOS 14, Apple shrunk the Siri interface so it appears at
the bottom of the screen, on top of whatever app you're using. If Siri's
response requires giving you feedback, that appears on top of the
current app as well.

Plus, when you receive a phone call, instead of the call taking over the
entire screen, you see a dark banner at the top of the screen with red
Decline and green Accept buttons. Tap either of those buttons, or tap or
swipe down the banner to reveal the full-screen call interface, where
you can also tap to answer. Want to delay? Swipe up on the banner to
shrink it to a button in the top-left corner of the screen.

These small changes make using Siri or answering phone calls feel much
more fluid than the approach of taking over the entire screen.

### Pinned Messages Conversations

We all have individuals and groups that we converse with regularly in
Messages. It's frustrating to hunt through the list of conversations to
find them, so iOS 14 adds the concept of "pinned" conversations. Touch
and hold on any conversation in the list to bring up a preview of the
last few messages and some commands. Then tap Pin to add the
conversation to the top of the Messages screen as a circular icon. From
then on, tap that icon to enter the conversation quickly.

iOS 14 sports many other features as well, and we'll be sharing more
about them in future articles. Remember, it's worth waiting a bit to
install, and note that iOS 14 is compatible with the iPhone 6s or later,
including the first-generation iPhone SE, and the current
seventh-generation iPod touch.

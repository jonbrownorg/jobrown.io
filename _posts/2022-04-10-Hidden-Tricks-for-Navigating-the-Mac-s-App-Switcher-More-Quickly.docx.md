Although the Mac's Dock shows all your running apps, it's often not the
most efficient way to switch among them. Instead, turn to the App
Switcher. You may know that pressing Command-Tab switches to the
last-used app, making it easy to flip back and forth between two apps.
However, if you press Command-Tab and continue to hold the Command key
down, the App Switcher itself appears, with icons for all running apps.
When you let up on the Command key, the App Switcher disappears, and
you'll switch to the selected app. To select an app, while the Command
key is down, press Tab or Shift-Tab to cycle through the apps, or hover
your pointer over the desired app. You can also click the desired app to
switch to it instantly, without letting up on the Command key. And if
you want to dismiss the App Switcher without switching apps, press Esc.

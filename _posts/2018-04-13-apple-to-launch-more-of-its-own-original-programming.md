According to the New York Times Apple has outspent both YouTube & Facebook on original programming for the debut of its TV & movie platform, we could see the new platform launched in the spring of 2019.

The New York Times reports Apple’s strong brand and ability to fund the project have made Apple attractive to both show creators and stars alike.

Apple is also reported to have leased a 128,000-square-foot in Culver City, California which will house some of Apple Music and the new entertainment division of Apple. Indeed, there are currently 763 job vacancies posted by Apple on LinkedIn based in [Culver City](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/apple-jobs-culver-city-ca/).

The report in the New York Times suggests Apple will spend over $1 billion dollars on programming blowing companies like Facebook and YouTube out of the water for spend on original content, Apple is reported to have even outbid Netflix on some of the shows.

Apple has already head hunted Zack Van Amburg and Jamie Erlicht from Sony Pictures Television back in 2017, At Sony Pictures Television, Van Amburg and Erlicht spearheaded ten years of expansion to the original programming tripling the number of prime time shows from Sony Pictures Television.

The shows could be watched via Apple's TV app or a new app charging a separate subscription for the streaming service. Annoyingly the Apple TV app is only available on the company's iPhone, iPad & Apple TV and is not yet available on the Mac.

Apple is investing on family friendly upbeat programming from big stars and big producers like Spielberg and Jennifer Aniston.

According to Wikipedia Apple has 12 shows in the pipeline which are:


**Title**|**Genre**|**Premiere**

I can’t wait to see what programming Apple comes up with and I really hope they make the service also available on my Macs, sometimes it’s nice to watch TV on a larger screen, it will also be interesting to see if Apple throws a curve ball allowing you for example to watch the shows via the Apple iWatch seems odd but this could be great on the morning commute if you don’t want to hold your iPhone or Tablet on the train or bus.

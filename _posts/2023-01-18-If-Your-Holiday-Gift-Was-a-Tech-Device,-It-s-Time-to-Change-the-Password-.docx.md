Whatever consumer electronics product you can name, there's probably a
"smart" version that you configure via an app or Internet-connected
interface once you've connected it to your Wi-Fi network. For ease of
setup and to keep costs down, many such devices come pre-configured with
not just a default username and password, but the *same* default
username and password as all other units. That's bad enough, but worse,
most people never change those defaults, which is just asking hackers
and malicious bots to break in and take over. This risk is real---it has
happened to [security
cameras](https://www.consumerreports.org/home-security-cameras/keep-home-security-cameras-from-being-hacked-a2927068390/),
[baby
monitors](https://www.groovypost.com/howto/secure-your-video-baby-monitor/),
[light
bulbs](https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/philips-hue-smart-light-bulb-hack-cyber-security-a9317456.html),
[DVRs](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/hacked-cameras-dvrs-powered-todays-massive-internet-outage/),
[toasters](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/10/we-built-a-fake-web-toaster-and-it-was-hacked-in-an-hour/505571/),
[refrigerators](https://www.newsweek.com/how-cyber-thieves-use-your-smart-fridge-door-your-data-1603488),
and even [fish
tanks](https://www.forbes.com/sites/leemathews/2017/07/27/criminals-hacked-a-fish-tank-to-steal-data-from-a-casino/?sh=3442653032b9).
So, if you received any so-called "Internet of Things" devices for the
holidays---or have one or more already installed on your home
network---immediately change the usernames (if possible) and passwords
to something more secure. Store the new usernames and passwords in your
password manager for future reference.

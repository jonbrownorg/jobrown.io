Although Apple has improved the built-in password management features in
macOS and iOS (you can now add notes to password entries!), third-party
password managers like [1Password](https://1password.com/) and
[LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/) are still more capable. For those
still getting started using a password manager, another new capability
will ease the transition: Safari password export. To export a CSV file
of your Safari passwords, choose Safari > Preferences > Passwords, and
enter your password when prompted. From the bottom of the left-hand
sidebar, click the ••• button, choose Export All Passwords, and save the
Passwords.csv file to the Desktop. After you import the file into
1Password
([instructions](https://support.1password.com/import-safari/)), LastPass
([instructions](https://support.logmeininc.com/lastpass/help/how-do-i-import-stored-data-into-lastpass-using-a-generic-csv-file)),
or another password manager, be sure to delete the exported file and
empty the trash.

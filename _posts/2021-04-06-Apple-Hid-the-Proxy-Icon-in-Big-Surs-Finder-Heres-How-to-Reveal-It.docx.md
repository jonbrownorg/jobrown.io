This is a twofer tip. You may not have known that every document window
in macOS has long had a *proxy icon* in the title bar, next to the
filename. The proxy icon is not just cosmetic. You can drag it to Mail
to attach the document to a message, to a Web browser to upload it, or
to any other location you can drag a document's icon in the Finder (top
screenshot, below, showing Preview in Catalina). You can also drag proxy
icons from Finder windows to Open and Save dialogs to navigate to the
location of the proxy icon and even pre-fill the filename when saving.
Alas, in macOS 11 Big Sur, in at least the Finder and Preview, Apple
chose to hide the proxy icon and the drop-down menu that lets you
rename, tag, or move files using controls on the title bar (middle
screenshot, below). Plus, the new title bar design tends to truncate
file names. Happily, mousing over the filename expands the name and
reveals both the proxy icon and the drop-down menu (bottom screenshot,
below). Apple's desire to reduce onscreen clutter makes usage more
cumbersome than before, but all the functionality is still present.

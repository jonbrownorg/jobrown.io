hat's the first thing you think about when you feel that first chilly
breeze of Fall? Is it cozy sweaters? Is it football? Is it pumpkin
spiced lattes? Well, I can tell you what it should be: cybersecurity!
October is Cybersecurity Awareness Month, and we are celebrating it in
style! Get ready for 31 days of tips, tricks, and strategies for keeping
you and your business cyber-safe!

The best cybersecurity plans go 24/7, 365 days a year, but that doesn't
mean you can't double down for one month. There's never too much
cybersecurity preparedness!

In October 2004, the Department of Homeland Security and the National
Cyber Security Alliance launched the first Cybersecurity Awareness
Month. It was started to help Americans be safe in a world where the
Internet was quickly becoming integral to our lives. Since its
inception, the month has only grown more important as our lives become
increasingly digitized. Both former DHS Secretaries and former
Presidents have played a part in past Cybersecurity Awareness Months. We
are only one of many industry participants who are taking this month to
educate our community on the importance of cybersecurity. College
campuses, non-profits, and other organizations frequently join in on the
fun as well.

Now, 31 days of pure digital goodness may sound like a lot, but remember
cybersecurity needs to be an all-day, everyday thing. Every day this
month we will be posting the most important tips that you need to stay
cyber-safe, so make sure to follow along with us on our social media
accounts. Also, pay attention for weekly blogs (like this one) that will
go into detail about the best ways to keep your cybersecurity tight. So
in between your apple pies and your favorite team winning the big game
(or not), keep an eye out for the best of the best cybersecurity advice
coming at you all month!

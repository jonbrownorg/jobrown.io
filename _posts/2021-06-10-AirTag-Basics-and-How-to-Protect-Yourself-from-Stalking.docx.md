Apple's new [AirTag](https://www.apple.com/airtag/) tracking device is
an amazing bit of technology---it's an elegant disc about the size of a
stack of four US quarters that communicates its location with other
Apple devices using Bluetooth and Ultra Wideband. Pair an AirTag with
your iPhone and put it in your laptop bag, and from then on, you can use
the Find My app to find your bag no matter where you've left it.

The key to the system is Apple's Find My network of hundreds of millions
of Apple devices, which detect nearby AirTags and report their location
to Apple's servers. It's all completely private and secure, so only the
owner of an AirTag can see where it is. All the devices in the Find My
network are anonymous, and location data is encrypted at every step of
the way. Not even Apple can locate an AirTag or determine the identity
of the device that helps find it.

Plus, if you have an iPhone 11 or iPhone 12 with support for Ultra
Wideband, the Find My app can use Precision Finding to give you the
direction and distance of your nearby items. ("You're getting warmer!")
If you need more help to locate an AirTag that's out of sight, you can
make it play a sound.

At $29 for one or $99 for a pack of four, AirTags are an inexpensive
way to keep track of keys, purses, suitcases, kids' backpacks, and more.
You could even attach one to your dog's collar, but it would likely be
helpful only in urban areas where people with iPhones would come close
enough to your rambling pet.

With great power comes great responsibility, though. There are always
those who will attempt to use AirTags to track other people's movements
surreptitiously, perhaps a jealous spouse, a vindictive ex, or someone
with a creepy crush. It wouldn't be hard to hide an AirTag in someone's
car, in a seldom-used purse pocket, or in the lining of a coat.

Apple is fully aware of these possibilities and has built three safeguards into the AirTags and the
Find My network. Given the potential for abuse, it's essential that
everyone knows what an AirTag is (done!) and how to determine if someone
may be using one to track another person (read on!).

-   **Safety Alerts:** If you get an "AirTag Found Moving With You"
    alert on your iPhone, you know that there's an AirTag separated from
    its owner that's traveling with you. Most likely, it's in something
    you're borrowing or attached to an item that someone left in your
    car. If you can't easily find the AirTag, you may be able to make it
    play a sound. (That won't work if the owner is in range or if it has
    been with you overnight such that its identifier has changed since
    the alert.) If you know why it's there, you can pause the safety
    alerts for a day or disable them permanently for those in your
    Family Sharing group. If the owner has marked it as lost, you can
    tap Learn About This AirTag to discover its serial number and
    contact information for the owner. If there's no good explanation
    for why the AirTag is with you, you can remove its battery to
    prevent it from reporting your location.

-   **Safety Sounds:** If an AirTag is separated from its owner for 3
    days, it will make a sound the next time it moves. There is some
    concern that 3 days may be too long and that the sound starts only
    after the AirTag moves. Apple has said it may change the time or
    tweak the system if the sound isn't achieving its goal of tattling
    on maliciously placed AirTags.

-   **NFC identification:** Let's say you find an AirTag after a safety
    alert or sound. Hold an iPhone or other NFC-capable smartphone to
    the white side of the AirTag and tap the notification to load a
    website with the AirTag's serial number and the last four digits of
    the owner's phone number (which may help you or the police identify
    them). If the owner has marked it as lost, you'll also see their
    phone number or email address.

The safety alerts appear only on iPhones,
of course, but there are two other requirements that must be true as
well. First, the iPhone must be running iOS 14.5 or later to display the
alerts, so make sure you update. Second, in Settings > *YourName* >
Find My > Find My iPhone, the Find My network option must be enabled.
If you don't want your iPhone to participate in the Find My network, you
can turn that option off, but doing so means you'll never receive a
safety alert either.

(A quick aside: the Find My iPhone option in that screen is necessary to
locate your iPhone if it's lost or stolen. It also enables Activation
Lock, which prevents a thief from erasing and reactivating your iPhone
unless they can find your Apple ID password. Always leave Find My iPhone
enabled. The Find My network can also help locate iPhones, iPads, Macs,
and Apple Watches that are offline and can't report their location to
Find My on their own.)

The ultimate takeaway is that if you ever get a safety alert, hear an
AirTag making a sound, or find an unexpected AirTag, hold your iPhone or
an NFC-capable Android phone to the white side of the AirTag to load a
Web page with more information. If you have reason to believe you're
being stalked, contact local law enforcement and give them the AirTag's
serial number, which they can use, with Apple's help, to identify the
AirTag's owner.

The threat of the Novel Coronairus has recently been a top concern worldwide. With many conspiracy theories, disinformation or just general curiosity many citizens are looking for more information on the outbreak from a trusted source. 

Cybercriminals are aware in the interest in these subjects and are crafting malicious emails designed to infect your computer or steal information. 

This means trying to get information on a virus could lead to a virus on your computer. In this recent scam people are impersonating the World Health Organization (WHO), a trusted name across the globe. Do not click links or download attachments to or about COVID-19.

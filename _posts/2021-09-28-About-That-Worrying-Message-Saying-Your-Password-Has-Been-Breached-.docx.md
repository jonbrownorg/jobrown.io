In iOS 14, Apple added a feature that warns you when one of your website
passwords stored in iCloud Keychain has appeared in a data breach. We've
fielded some questions of late from people worrying if the message is
legitimate, and if so, what they should do. What has happened is that
online criminals have stolen username and password data from a company,
and your credentials were included in that data breach. You should
indeed change your password immediately, and it's fine to let the iPhone
suggest a strong password for you. Or, if it makes you feel more
comfortable, you can usually change the password in Safari on your Mac
instead. Either way, make sure it's unique---never reuse passwords
across multiple sites!

Apple Business Manager and Apple School Manager are excellent systems of record. They tell you exactly what devices you own, who they’re assigned to, and how they’re enrolled. For inventory, they are authoritative. For risk, they are silent.

What neither platform shows you is which devices are quietly becoming liabilities.

Warranty expiration is not surfaced. AppleCare+ status is not prioritized. Devices that are weeks away from falling out of coverage look exactly the same as devices that are fully protected. Unless you manually click into individual records, export data, or maintain a parallel spreadsheet, there is no way to understand risk across a fleet at a glance. As environments grow, that gap doesn’t just persist — it compounds.

This is the problem that led me to build ABM Warranty.

In our own organization, we needed a way to ensure company devices stayed under warranty. Not as a “nice to have,” but as a deliberate operational strategy. Many of our employees work remotely. They don’t have the luxury of walking into an office staffed with hardware technicians. When something goes wrong, the difference between being under warranty and out of warranty is the difference between a fast replacement and a costly, time-consuming disruption.

Keeping devices covered gives peace of mind. It protects the business from unexpected repair costs, and it protects employees by giving them flexibility to get service wherever they are. Out-of-warranty repairs are expensive, unpredictable, and difficult to budget for. When you manage this proactively, warranty coverage becomes a safety net instead of an afterthought.

This has become even more relevant as Apple hardware longevity has increased. The M1 through M3 generations age exceptionally well. Devices remain fast, reliable, and useful longer than traditional replacement cycles assumed. Apple itself recommends a three to four year lifecycle, but also offers renewable warranties for a reason. Many organizations can reset, redeploy, and continue using hardware with a high degree of confidence — as long as coverage is maintained.

The challenge isn’t deciding whether to renew or replace. The challenge is knowing which devices need action, and when.

Apple Business Manager and Apple School Manager were never designed to answer that question. They are inventory platforms, not lifecycle dashboards. Even if Apple eventually adds a native warranty dashboard — and it would make sense for them to do so — exporting and acting on that data would still be a real operational need. Organizations don’t just want to see information. They need to report on it, share it, and integrate it into planning workflows.

In the meantime, teams are left building fragile processes outside of Apple’s tools. Manual exports. Spreadsheets. Ad hoc scripts. Repeated logins across multiple accounts. None of this scales cleanly, especially for MSPs, school districts, or enterprises managing multiple Apple Business Manager or Apple School Manager environments.

ABM Warranty exists to bridge that gap.

It provides a focused dashboard that surfaces warranty and AppleCare+ risk immediately. Devices approaching expiration are visible without hunting. Prebuilt filters make it easy to answer questions like “what is expiring soon,” “what is already out of coverage,” and “what needs attention right now.” Data can be exported securely for reporting, budgeting, or asset tracking without scraping or workarounds.

For organizations with multiple ABM or ASM accounts, switching between environments is intentional and safe. There’s no logging in and out, no credential confusion, and no data crossover. Everything stays local, private, and under the administrator’s control.

This isn’t about replacing Apple’s platforms. It’s about completing them. Inventory tells you what you own. Warranty tracking tells you what’s at risk.

If you manage more than a few dozen Apple devices, this is worth paying attention to. Warranty coverage isn’t just a line item — it’s part of a sustainable device program. Until Apple provides a native way to surface and act on this information, administrators still need answers. ABM Warranty is how I solved that problem for our own fleet, and it’s built to solve it for others facing the same reality.

If this problem sounds familiar, I’d encourage you to try [ABM Warranty](https://jonbrown.org/apps/#warranty) in your own environment and see how it fits into your workflow. The app is available now, and the [beta program](https://testflight.apple.com/join/KGNj2cTd) is open specifically so Apple IT administrators, MSPs, and school IT teams can put it through real-world use. Your feedback directly influences how the product evolves, from how warranty risk is surfaced to how data is exported and acted on across multiple accounts. If you manage Apple devices at scale, downloading the app, testing it with your fleet, and sharing what works — and what doesn’t — is the fastest way to help shape a tool designed for the realities of modern Apple management.

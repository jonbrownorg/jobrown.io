So how many is your team now, Jon? We are a team of three full-time, me and two others, and we have one part-time person. And then we've got about 4 1099 contractors that help us out as needed. Joe and I and over the years have talked about the hiring process and how frustrating it can be and I, I toyed with the idea of someone working maybe on a part-time basis or 1099 basis.

You mentioned your staff, getting them accustomed to talking with the community on Mac admins. And I think that's something that I've always encouraged as well is reach out, especially if we don't have a collective answer internally. There's a whole host of people out there that are always looking to help.

And you might get the occasional snarky responses here and there, but for the most part,  everyone's looking to assist each other in a lot of ways. And I love that part about the Apple community and especially on the Mac admin Slack. It's just amazing to see.

Photos has long provided a [hidden
album](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205891) you could use to hold
images you wanted to keep a little more private. Until this year,
however, it was security through obscurity: anyone who knew to reveal
the album in Settings \> Photos on an iPhone or iPad or by choosing View
\> Show Hidden Album on the Mac could see its contents. Now you can
protect it---and the Recently Deleted album---with Face ID or Touch ID
on an iPhone or iPad, or Touch ID or your password on a Mac. You can
enable this feature in iOS 16 or iPadOS 16 using Settings \> Photos \>
Use Face ID/Touch ID; in macOS 13 Ventura, choose Photos \> Settings \>
General and select "Use Touch ID or password." From then on, opening
those albums will require authentication.

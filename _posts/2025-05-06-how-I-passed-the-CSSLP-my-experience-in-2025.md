# How I Passed the CSSLP — My Experience in 2025

After passing the CISSP earlier this year, I decided to follow it up with the **Certified Secure Software Lifecycle Professional (CSSLP)** certification. For those unfamiliar, CSSLP is an ISC2 certification that focuses specifically on secure software development practices across the full SDLC—from requirements and design to coding, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

Where the CISSP is broad, the CSSLP is laser-focused. This exam dives deep into secure software principles, threat modeling, data protection, API security, database hardening, and development methodologies like Agile, DevOps, and DevSecOps. It’s not just for coders—it’s for anyone who wants to lead or contribute to building secure software systems in a world where security is no longer optional.

## Why I Took the CSSLP

I’ve been involved in web and app development since 2009. I’ve launched iOS apps, built and deployed dozens of websites, and been part of product teams at various stages—from startup MVPs to enterprise-grade platforms. As my career has evolved, I’ve found myself increasingly leading DevOps and security conversations, working to ensure that security is baked in, not bolted on.

The CSSLP was my way of formalizing those skills. I wanted to demonstrate not just that I can write code, but that I can lead secure development efforts, manage cross-functional teams, and make decisions that protect both users and businesses.

## How I Prepared

Here’s what worked for me:

📘 **Read the Official ISC2 CBK for CSSLP** — It’s dry but comprehensive. I read it cover to cover to ensure no domain slipped through the cracks.

📗 **All-In-One CSSLP Exam Guide by McGraw Hill** — Easier to digest and a great companion to the CBK.

🎧 **Listened to the audiobook Essential CSSLP Exam Guide (2nd Edition) by Phil Martin** — Fantastic for commuting or passive review.

🎥 **Pluralsight CSSLP Exam Prep by Kevin Henry** — I always find Kevin’s teaching style solid. It’s a good secondary resource.

📱 **Pocket Prep CISSP iOS App (with CSSLP question set)** — Surprisingly helpful. Great for quick quiz sessions and reinforcing weaker domains.

## Study Tips, Tricks & Mental Prep

A few things I picked up from Reddit and the CSSLP community:

- **Understand the “why,” not just the “what.”** This exam wants you to think like someone designing secure systems from the ground up, not just checking boxes.
- **Think like a security lead in a dev team.** You’re not just fixing code—you’re preventing risk early.
- **Practice threat modeling scenarios.** Visualizing workflows and thinking about data flow, trust boundaries, and attack surfaces helps immensely.
- **Get good at eliminating wrong answers.** Like the CISSP, some questions will feel vague. Learn to rule out two obviously wrong options quickly.
- **Mentally prepare to sit for a long exam.** It’s 3 hours of intense focus. Don’t underestimate the mental load. Get rest the night before and stay hydrated.

## Real-World Relevance

This wasn’t just a checkbox for me. The CSSLP aligns directly with the work I do—and want to do more of. It validated my experience with:

✅ **Secure SDLC design and integration**  
🔐 **Data classification, protection, and access control**  
🧰 **DevOps/DevSecOps processes and tooling**  
🧱 **Database design and hardening techniques**  
📄 **Policy, governance, and compliance as they relate to development**  

With this under my belt, I feel more confident leading secure development teams, making risk-based decisions, and aligning product goals with security from day one.

If you’re considering the CSSLP, feel free to reach out or drop a comment. Happy to share more about my experience and help you prep!

## Final Thoughts

Achieving the CSSLP certification has been a rewarding and enriching experience. It not only enhanced my technical understanding of secure software practices but also gave me a clearer perspective on how to integrate security seamlessly throughout the entire development lifecycle. With the increasing focus on security, it’s essential that developers, security leads, and engineers work together to build secure software from day one. I’m excited to continue applying these best practices and share the knowledge with the teams I work with.

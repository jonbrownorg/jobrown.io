## 🎯 The Long Road to PMP

Back in **2013**, I registered for a PMI membership with every intention of pursuing my PMP certification. I downloaded the handbook, bookmarked the eligibility requirements, and even told a few friends that I was going to do it “soon.”  

Then life happened.  

For more than a decade, my membership sat dormant. Projects came and went. Teams grew, companies evolved, and yet that little unchecked box — *“Get PMP Certified”* — stayed on my to-do list.  

Fast forward to **2024**, and I finally decided it was time to finish what I started.

## 🧾 The Hardest Part Wasn’t the Exam

Everyone talks about how difficult the PMP exam is (and it is tough), but honestly, **the hardest part was just applying**.

Gathering all the documentation to prove I met PMI’s experience requirements took weeks. The 35-hour PDU education requirement was another hurdle, and writing up each project experience with the correct terminology was a project in itself.

But once I hit “Submit” and received that long-awaited approval email — it became real.

## 📚 The Study Year: Motivation Comes in Waves

I gave myself roughly a year to study, and it was far from perfect. There were stretches where I studied daily, and others where I ignored it completely for weeks.  

My **practice exam scores hovered between 65–70%**, no matter what platform I used. Even as test day approached, I never once scored high enough to feel “ready.”  

Here’s what I used throughout my prep:
- **PMI Study Hall+** — an official PMI platform that helped me get comfortable with the exam’s tone and structure.  
- **PMP Pocket Prep (iOS app)** — great for daily bursts of review questions, especially during lunch breaks or while traveling.  
- **PMI’s official practice exam** — worth every penny for the realism and pacing alone.

## 🧠 The Mindset Shift That Changed Everything

The night before my exam, I stumbled across a [YouTube video by Andrew Ramdayal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u0rO-YQr9c).  
It wasn’t another “memorize this formula” lecture — it was about how to *think* like a project manager during the exam.  

That video changed my entire approach.  

Instead of memorizing inputs, tools, and outputs, I focused on **situational reasoning** — asking, “What would a *servant leader* do here?” or “What’s the *best next step* for the team?”  

The next morning, I walked into the test center feeling uncertain but strangely calm.

## 💻 Exam Day: Expect to Feel Like You Failed

Right after the exam I was convinced I had failed, the walk from the test computer to the front desk at the Pearson testing center felt like an eternity while I waited for my score printout.  

As I unfolded the printout, there it was: **“Congratulations! You passed.”**  

My performance by domain:
- 👥 **People:** Target  
- ⚙️ **Process:** Above Target  
- 🌍 **Business Environment:** Target  

✅ **Overall Performance:** Pass  

After over a decade of thinking about it, I finally did it.

## 💬 Lessons Learned

If you’re planning your own PMP journey, here’s what I wish someone had told me:

- The *application* is your first project — treat it like one.  
- You’ll never feel 100% ready — schedule the exam anyway.  
- Progress is messy; consistency beats intensity.  
- Learn the mindset, not the memorization.  

The PMP exam is less about remembering facts and more about **thinking like a project manager** under pressure.

## 🏁 Final Thoughts

It took me **twelve years** to close the loop on something I started in 2013. And while I could beat myself up for taking that long, I’ve realized this:  

Professional growth doesn’t have an expiration date.  

The moment you start — whether it’s studying for a certification, changing careers, or reviving a long-forgotten goal — you’re already further than you were yesterday.  

Keep going. 💪

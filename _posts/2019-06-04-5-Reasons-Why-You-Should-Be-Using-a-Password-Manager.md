We often recommend using a password manager like 1Password or LastPass,
but we've gotten a few questions asking why we're so adamant about this.
Lots of people think that all they need to do to keep their online
accounts secure is create a single password with some numbers, often
switching a lowercase L with a 1 and a capital E with a 3. And that's
for accounts people care about---for those that they don't see as
important, they're likely to use a simple password like their child's or
pet's name. Plus, most people don't think they have much to protect or
that they would be targeted by hackers, so they reuse the same password
across multiple sites.

Guess what? Such an approach is extremely dangerous on today's Internet.
First off, no one is explicitly targeted. The bad guys get passwords by
stealing them by the millions from Web sites with lax security. Then
they use sophisticated hardware that can try over *350 billion passwords
per second* to decrypt as many of the stolen passwords as possible. All
passwords under 13 characters can be cracked easily by such hardware.

Next, imagine you have a password on a shopping site whose passwords are
stolen. The attackers can log in to that site, change your shipping
address, and order items with your stored credit card. But they won't
stop there. They'll use automated software to try that username and
password combination on lots of other high-profile sites: Google, Apple,
Amazon, eBay, Facebook, many banks, and so on. If they can get in
anywhere, they'll take over the account and exploit it in any way they
can, which could involve stealing money, ordering goods, or using it to
reset passwords and lock you out of other accounts. [It can get ugly
fast.](https://www.wired.com/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/){:rel="nofollow"}

Use a password manager to generate, store, and enter strong passwords,
one for each site, and you'll never have any of these problems. A
sufficiently strong password (16 characters minimum, but we recommend 20
when possible) will withstand cracking efforts for centuries, and if you
have a different password for every site, even one password being
compromised won't expose any of your other accounts to abuse.

Here then are five reasons for using a password manager:

1.  **Generate strong passwords:** A password should be random, or it
should be a long collection of words (think 30+ characters).
Password managers can generate such passwords for you, so it's
easy to make a new one for each Web site.

2.  **Store passwords securely:** If you're going to put all your eggs
in one basket, you want that basket to be well protected. Password
managers employ their own strong encryption and various other
techniques to ensure that your passwords are safe.

3.  **Enter passwords for you:** No one can remember and type long,
random passwords, but having a password manager enter the password
for you is even easier than typing a weak password. Log in faster
than ever before!

4.  **Audit existing accounts:** Password managers learn the credentials
you use for existing accounts, and they can tell you which
passwords are weak and which have been reused.

5.  **Access passwords on all your devices:** It's even harder to type
passwords on an iPhone or iPad, but good password managers have
apps for mobile devices that sync with your password archive so
all your passwords are available whenever you need them.

There are many different password managers, but for most people, there
are three main choices. If you use only Safari on the Mac and in iOS,
Apple's built-in [iCloud
Keychain](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204085){:rel="nofollow"} feature
may be sufficient.

If you're mostly an Apple user but also need support for Windows and
Android, or if you want to share some passwords with family members or
your workgroup, [1Password](https://1password.com/){:rel="nofollow"} is the
best choice. It costs \$3 per month for an individual or \$5 per month
for a family, with team and business accounts as well. 1Password also
offers add-ons for non-Apple browsers like Chrome and Firefox.

And if 1Password is too expensive, or if you're platform
agnostic, [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/){:rel="nofollow"} offers a
solid set of features for free. Additional features and password sharing
cost \$3 per month for individuals and \$4 per month for families, and
again, team and enterprise accounts are available.

If you need help choosing among these three or setting them up,
particularly in the context of a small business, get in touch with us.
And if you'd like us to write more about each of these options, just
drop us a note and we'll see what we can do.

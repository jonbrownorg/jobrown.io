One of the big no-nos with passwords is sending them to other people as
plain text in email or a text message conversation. You presumably trust
your recipient with the password, but what if their email was hacked or
phone stolen? Instead, always use a site like
[1ty.me](https://1ty.me/){:rel="nofollow"} or [One-Time
Secret](https://onetimesecret.com/){:rel="nofollow"}, which lets you turn a
password into a Web link that can be opened only once. Send that link to
the recipient, and when they get the password out, they can store it in
a secure password manager like
[1Password](https://1password.com/){:rel="nofollow"} or
[LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/){:rel="nofollow"}.

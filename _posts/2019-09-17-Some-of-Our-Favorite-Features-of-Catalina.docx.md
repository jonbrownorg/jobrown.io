In a break from Apple's pattern of alternating cycle of releases,
[macOS 10.15
Catalina](https://www.apple.com/macos/catalina-preview/){:rel="nofollow"} is
not a refinement of 10.14 Mojave like 10.13 High Sierra was for 10.12
Sierra. Instead, Catalina boasts significant changes, both obvious
things like new apps and less-obvious things like under-the-hood
improvements. Here are some of our favorites.

### iTunes Is Dead! Long Live Music, TV, and Podcasts

After 18 years of being a fixture on the Mac, the increasingly bloated
iTunes has been replaced with a trio of independent apps: Music, TV, and
Podcasts. Note that the iOS device syncing features of iTunes have moved
to the sidebar in Finder windows.

### Major App Updates: Reminders, Notes, and Photos

The ease of telling Siri "Remind me to touch base with Javier tomorrow
at 10 AM" has long made Reminders useful, but the Reminders app itself
was weak. Apple has overhauled it in Catalina, giving it a completely
new interface that lets you create smart lists that collect tasks from
multiple lists, add attachments to tasks, and click buttons to add
dates, times, locations, and flags to reminders instantly. Best of all,
lists finally have their own sort orders! Note that to see some of the
new features, you must upgrade your Reminders database on all your
devices and those of anyone with whom you share lists, so you may need
to wait until everything and everyone is up to date.

Notes gains a new gallery view that provides thumbnail instead of a
scrolling list. More practically, you can now share entire folders as
well as notes, and for both, you can limit collaborators to read-only
mode. If you use lists in Notes, you'll like the new checklist features
for reordering list items, moving checked items to the bottom, and
easily unchecking all items to reuse the list.

With Photos, Apple redesigned how the main Photos view displays your
pictures. Previously, it started with Years, zoomed in to Collections,
and zoomed in again to Moments. Now Photos uses a more sensible Years,
Months, Days hierarchy, with Years and Months using a large, easily
viewed grid, and Days showing selected thumbnails of different sizes to
focus attention on the best images. All Photos still shows everything in
a grid. Apple also enhanced the machine-learning aspects of Photos so it
can better understand who is in each shot and what's happening---this
helps Photos to highlight important moments and create better Memories.
And you can now edit Memory movies on the Mac as well as iOS.

### Screen Time Replaces Parental Controls

Last year, iOS 12 introduced Screen Time, which helps you monitor app
usage and how often you're distracted by pickups or notifications. Plus,
it lets you set limits on particular categories of apps and make sure
you don't use your device when you should be sleeping. Even better, it
enables you to manage what your kids can do on their iOS devices, when
they can do it, and for how long.

All that goodness has now migrated to the Mac in Catalina, replacing the
old parental controls, so if your middle-schooler needs help avoiding
games when homework is due, or in putting the Mac to sleep when it's
bedtime, the new Screen Time pane of System Preferences has the controls
you need. It also provides a wide variety of content and privacy
controls.

### Voice Control Your Mac

Although Apple has buried the new Voice Control settings in System
Preferences \> Accessibility \> Voice Control, if you've ever wanted to
control your Mac with your voice, give it a try. It's astonishing, and
you really can run through a set of commands and dictation like this:

> *Open TextEdit. Click New Document. 'Four score and seven years ago
> our fathers brought forth on this continent comma a new nation comma
> conceived in liberty comma and dedicated to the proposition that all
> men are created equal period' Click File menu. Click Save. 'Gettysburg
> address.' Click Save button.*

You can even use your voice to edit the text you dictate! Make sure to
scan through the full set of commands to see what's possible, and
remember that you can add your own commands.

### Enhanced Security and Privacy

Apple continues to improve macOS's security and privacy controls in a
variety of ways:

-   In Catalina, the operating system runs in a dedicated read-only
    system volume that prevents anything from overwriting or subverting
    critical files.

-   Kernel extensions, which are often required for hardware
    peripherals, now run separately from macOS, preventing them from
    causing crashes or security vulnerabilities.

-   All new apps, whether from the App Store or directly from
    developers, must now be "notarized," which means Apple has checked
    them for known security issues.

-   Macs with Apple's T2 security chip now support Activation Lock in
    Catalina, so if they're stolen, there's no way to erase and
    reactivate them.

-   Catalina now plays a mean game of "Mother, May I?," so apps will
    have to ask permission to access data in your main folders, before
    they can perform keylogging, and if they want to capture still or
    video recordings of your screen, among other things. Apps even have
    to ask to be allowed to put up notifications. Be prepared for an
    awful lot of access-request dialogs.

### Attach an iPad Sidecar to Your Mac

Our final favorite feature in Catalina is Sidecar, which enables you to
connect an iPad to your Mac and use it as a secondary screen, either
extending your Desktop or mirroring what's on the main display. It does
require a relatively recent Mac and an iPad running iOS 13, but it works
either wired or wireless.

On the iPad, you can keep using Multi-Touch gestures, and Sidecar even
supports the Apple Pencil so you can use the iPad like a graphics
tablet. Apps that have Touch Bar support will display their controls on
the bottom of the iPad screen, even on Macs without a Touch Bar.

### More Smaller Features

Those are our favorite big features, but Catalina boasts plenty of
smaller ones too:

-   A new Find My app combines Find My iPhone and Find My Friends into
    one.

-   Find My can locate offline devices using crowd-sourced locations.

-   Apple Watch users can authenticate anywhere on the Mac by
    double-clicking the side button. (Oh, thank you, Apple!)

-   Mail can block email from specified senders and move their messages
    directly to the trash.

-   You can mute specific Mail threads to stop notifications from chatty
    email conversations.

Enough! We'll keep covering new Catalina features, but once you upgrade,
spend some time exploring, since there are so many neat new things you
can do. And remember, we recommend caution when upgrading your Mac---see
our earlier article on that topic.

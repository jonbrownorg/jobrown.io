So you've gotten your COVID-19 vaccination. Congratulations, and thank
you for nudging the planet closer to the herd immunity needed for life
to return to normal! It's a good idea to take a photo of your card as a
backup before filing it with your other important papers, just in case.
(If you lose the original, you may be able to get a new one from the
site where you got the vaccine or through your state's [Immunization
Information
System](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/contacts-locate-records.html#state).)
However, we do want to offer a note of caution. Resist the urge to post
that photo---or one of you gleefully brandishing your card---on social
media. The cards include your name, date of birth, vaccine location, and
other personal information that could be used to steal your identity,
and any digital miscreant worth their salt is already trawling through
your social media feeds for as much personal information as they can
find.

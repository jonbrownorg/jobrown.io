## Update AirPort Express Base Stations to Add AirPlay 2 
---

Apple may have discontinued its AirPort Wi-Fi base stations, but in a
surprise parting gift, the company has released a firmware update to the
AirPort Express that gives it AirPlay 2 capabilities like multi-room
audio. If you have an AirPort Express connected to speakers through its
audio jack, first use AirPort Utility on the Mac or iPhone to update its
firmware to version 7.8. Once you do that, you'll be able to play audio
simultaneously through the AirPort Express and to other AirPlay
2--enabled devices, such as the HomePod and Apple TV.

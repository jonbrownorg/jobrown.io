When you're writing a blog post or email newsletter, you'll eventually
hit the question of how to capitalize words in a title. There is no one
right way, but just as with poor spelling and grammar, randomly
capitalized titles can reduce reader trust in your knowledge,
competence, and expertise. The trick is to pick a capitalization form
and style guide to follow. There are two capitalization forms: *title
case* (where important words are capitalized) and *sentence case* (which
is capitalized like a normal sentence). Then there are a handful of
major style guides, including the [Associated Press
Stylebook](https://www.apstylebook.com/){:rel="nofollow"}, [The Chicago Manual of
Style](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html){:rel="nofollow"}, and [The
New York Times Manual of Style and
Usage](https://www.amazon.com/York-Times-Manual-Style-Usage/dp/081296389X){:rel="nofollow"}.
It's never a bad idea to pick one and learn its rules, but for a quick
shortcut, turn to the [Capitalize My Title Web
site](https://capitalizemytitle.com/){:rel="nofollow"}. Click a style guide tab at
the top, select a capitalization form, and paste or type your title. The
site automatically applies the appropriate rules to your title. Press
Return to copy it to the clipboard for pasting into your document.

Apple’s new [iPhone 8 series][1] builds upon its popular existing model. The latest model iPhone 8 series is a premium series for its tenth anniversary. At the same time that Apple introduced its best and most expensive smartphone option, it also lowered the price on prior models, therefore making the iPhone 8 a compelling upgrade only for buyers who want the best.

The new model series debuts at $699 as the most expensive model and offers a large upgrade from prior series. Prior iPhone models such as the iPhone SE are just $399 and still offer great computing power, fast cameras and more. Apple will also continue to sell the iPhone 7 and iPhone 6s. The iPhone 8 is just now a higher tier, premium model.

Shortly after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Apple made it so your
Apple Watch could unlock your Face ID-enabled iPhone when you were
wearing a mask. Starting in iOS 15.4, the company has taken the next
step and enabled Face ID on the iPhone 12 and later to work [even when
you're wearing a mask](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213062). If you
didn't already set up Face ID with a mask after updating to iOS 15.4, go
to Settings > Face ID & Passcode and enable Face ID with a Mask. You'll
have to run through the Face ID training sequence again, and more than
once if you sometimes wear glasses, but it's quick and easy. Face ID may
not work quite as well when you're wearing a mask, and it doesn't
support sunglasses, but it's way better than having to enter your
passcode whenever you're masked.

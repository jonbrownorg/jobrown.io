Whether you're working from home or just stuck at home, it can be tough
to communicate with colleagues, friends, or family. Sure, there's email,
but that gets hard to manage quickly, and it can be difficult to stay
focused with so much news rolling in. For friends and family, Facebook
might seem to be the digital town square. However, many people avoid
Facebook due to its impressive record of abusing its users' privacy,
failure to protect that user data from hackers, and exploitation by
foreign governments. And it's wildly inappropriate for most business
communications.

For an alternative that doesn't involve relying on overloaded email
inboxes or handing everything about your online life over to a corporate
Big Brother, consider the group messaging tool
[Slack](https://slack.com/), which has become popular with small
and large firms, non-profits, academic departments, student project
teams, and government agencies. Although it's aimed at organizations
that pay a monthly fee for every active user, Slack offers a free tier
with all the features you would need to create your own online community
for your workgroup, family, or friends. Everyone can join in since Slack
has apps for[macOS](https://slack.com/downloads/osx),[iOS](https://slack.com/downloads/ios),[Windows](https://slack.com/downloads/windows), and
[Android](https://slack.com/downloads/android), and it can
be used in any desktop Web browser.

Conceptually, Slack is similar to Apple's Messages, in that you can
communicate with others by typing short messages and sharing graphics
and other files. You can even have one-on-one voice calls (group calls,
screen sharing, and videoconferencing are limited to the paid
plans).

What sets Slack apart from Messages, WhatsApp, Google Hangouts, and the
like is that it lets you segment discussions into "channels," which can
either be public, such that everyone in the group can see them, or
private, so only invitees can participate. Plus, you can have "direct
message" conversations with one or more individuals.

The beauty of Slack channels is that they're easy to create, and they
bring together all communications relevant to a particular group,
project, client, or topic. Channels help focus discussions, so those who
are interested in only certain channels aren't overwhelmed by irrelevant
chatter.

For an extended family, you might create channels by branch (so your
brother can ignore your in-laws' conversations), parts of the country
(so relatives who live elsewhere don't have to see the local family
members' dinner plans), and events (like Hanukkah or a family reunion).
Or, in a design team's Slack group, you might want channels for each
major client or project, along with channels for financial or human
resources topics. There's no one right answer---the goal is merely to
keep discussions relevant and focused.

How do you keep up on discussions? Slack has flexible notifications,
letting you choose at the top level to be notified about everything;
just direct messages, mentions, and keywords; or nothing---at which
point you can check in manually. You can also choose to be notified of
replies to threads you're in. Then you can override those defaults for
any channel or conversation, which lets you ensure you're notified only
by people or topics that interest you. Plus, if you leave your Mac,
Slack can repoint notifications to your iPhone automatically, with
separate settings to make sure you aren't overly nagged while at your
kid's track meet.

Slack provides tons of other features that can prove useful in groups of
any size. You can share and comment on files of any type, which is far
more effective than sending attachments around in email. You can create
"posts" and get others to edit them collaboratively---a boon when trying
to craft the perfect bit of text for some purpose. And you can integrate
[hundreds of Internet services](https://slack.com/apps) into
Slack so it can act as a single dashboard for many other apps, including
the likes of the videoconferencing tool Zoom.

Getting started with Slack is fairly easy, and we recommend the
following basic steps.

-   **Create a Slack workspace.** Slack provides
    [instructions](https://slack.com/help/articles/206845317-Create-a-Slack-workspace)
    for basic setup.
-   **Set up channels.** [Create a few
    channels](https://slack.com/help/articles/201402297-Create-a-channel)
    to help people feel like they're in the right place. You can always
    make more channels later.
-   **Invite people in.** You can [invite users to
    your
    Slack](https://slack.com/help/articles/201330256-Invite-new-members-to-your-workspace)
    during setup, but it's better to wait until you've set up your
    channels. Make sure to use everyone's preferred email address when
    inviting them.
-   **Help people install Slack apps.** For those
    who are tech-savvy, [installing Slack's client
    apps](https://slack.com/help/categories/360000049043-Getting-started#download-the-slack-app)
    isn't hard, but you might need to provide support for those who are less experienced.
-   **Provide name advice.** Slack lets each user
    set [a full name and a display
    name](https://slack.com/help/articles/216360827-Change-your-display-name),
    and you might want to recommend a particular format (first name
    only, or first name and last initial) that makes display names unique and easily understood and typed.
-   **Help people configure notifications.**
    Perhaps the hardest part of using Slack is getting notifications
    adjusted right for each person. Slack offers guides for
    [desktop](https://slack.com/help/articles/201355156-Guide-to-desktop-notifications),
    [email](https://slack.com/help/articles/360042339754-Guide-to-email-notifications),
    and
    [mobile](https://slack.com/help/articles/360025446073-Guide-to-mobile-notifications)
    notifications, along with [additional
    help](https://slack.com/help/categories/360000047906-Your-profile-preferences#adjust-your-notifications).

For additional advice on setting up and using Slack, consider Glenn
Fleishman's book [*Take Control of
Slack*](https://www.takecontrolbooks.com/slack/), which goes
beyond Slack's help to provide real-world setup and configuration
advice. We're also happy to help provide setup and configuration
advice---just get in touch.

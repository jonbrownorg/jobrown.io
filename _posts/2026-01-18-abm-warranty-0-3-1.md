The 0.3.x release series for ABM Warranty is about tightening guarantees. Where earlier releases focused on surfacing data and making long-running operations observable, 0.3.x focuses on ensuring that what you see is complete, consistent, and safe to trust—particularly as the app is used in larger, slower, and more varied environments.

Version 0.3.0 introduced several foundational changes, while 0.3.1 follows shortly behind as a maintenance release that reinforces those foundations with important fixes and consistency improvements.

## ABM and ASM Credentials, Explicitly Supported

</div>

ABM Warranty 0.3.0 adds first-class support for both Apple Business Manager and Apple School Manager credentials. Rather than treating these environments as interchangeable, the app now recognizes and handles them explicitly, allowing administrators and consultants working across commercial and education fleets to use the same tooling with clearer expectations about scope and behavior.

This work also laid the groundwork for more advanced credential handling in the future. Credentials are now clearly separated based on how they are provided, whether entered manually by an admin or deployed and managed externally. That distinction matters, because it influences how credentials are validated, stored, and protected over time.

## Safer Credential Handling by Design

Credential handling in 0.3.0 was intentionally conservative. Credentials are validated explicitly before any import is allowed to begin, reducing the chance of partial or misleading data caused by misconfiguration. At the same time, credentials are never used to trigger destructive behavior automatically. Saving or updating credentials does not overwrite existing data, and imports do not start implicitly unless validation has completed successfully.

In environments where ABM or ASM data is used to make lifecycle or financial decisions, it is better to be deliberate than clever. 0.3.0 favors predictability and auditability over convenience shortcuts.

## Clearer Imports and More Resilient Coverage Fetching

Imports in 0.3.0 are more transparent and more resilient. The app now surfaces clearer import phases and progress indicators so that administrators can see where time is being spent and why an operation may be waiting rather than failing.

Coverage fetching has also been hardened. Retry behavior is more consistent, and transient failures are handled in a way that prioritizes eventual completeness over speed. This is particularly important in large or rate-limited environments where coverage requests may be throttled or delayed. Rather than silently skipping or partially persisting results, the app now works harder to ensure that coverage data is fetched and retained correctly.

## Better Handling of Inactive and No-Data Devices

<div 
  class="w-full max-w-4xl mx-auto my-0 p-6 rounded-xl overflow-hidden bg-cover bg-center"
  style="background-image: url('/images/macos/tahoe/bg.png');"

      alt="ABM Warranty Screenshot"
      class="mx-auto"
    />
</div>

Another focus area in 0.3.0 is how devices that fall outside the “happy path” are represented. Devices that no longer appear in ABM or ASM are handled more cleanly as inactive records rather than disappearing unexpectedly. Devices that lack complete data are identified more clearly, making it easier to distinguish between temporary gaps and genuine lifecycle transitions.

These refinements reduce ambiguity on the dashboard and help ensure that counts, filters, and device states reflect reality rather than transient import conditions.

## UX Refinements with an Eye Toward What’s Next

<div 
  class="w-full max-w-4xl mx-auto my-0 p-6 rounded-xl overflow-hidden bg-cover bg-center"
  style="background-image: url('/images/macos/tahoe/bg.png');"

    <img 
      src="/assets/images/blog/2025/warranty/3/3.png" 
      alt="ABM Warranty Screenshot"
      class="mx-auto"
    />
</div>

Several user experience changes in 0.3.0 may appear subtle, but they are intentional. Settings and import workflows were refined to make credential state, data state, and import readiness more obvious. These changes also prepare the app for future expansion, including support for multiple credential sets and more advanced tenant isolation in a future major release.

That work is ongoing, and while multi-credential and multi-tenant workflows are not shipping in 0.3.1, the app is now structured to support them without needing to revisit fundamental assumptions later.

## 0.3.1: Fixes That Reinforce Trust

Version 0.3.1 is a maintenance release focused on correctness and stability. It addresses rare but important cases where devices could import successfully while coverage details were missing or incomplete. Persistence issues that could cause coverage data to be overwritten or lost under certain conditions have been fixed, ensuring that once coverage is fetched, it remains stable and reliable.

Dashboard accuracy was another area of improvement. In 0.3.1, counts shown on the dashboard always align with filtered device lists, even in large or slow environments where imports and coverage fetches may span long periods of time. These changes reduce confusion and reinforce confidence in what the dashboard is showing at any given moment.

More broadly, 0.3.1 improves consistency when working with large fleets or environments that respond slowly or unevenly. Alongside these targeted fixes, the release includes general reliability and stability improvements that make day-to-day use calmer and more predictable.

## Looking Ahead

The 0.3 series is about making ABM Warranty more dependable as it expands to support more environments and more complex workflows. The focus remains on correctness, data integrity, and transparency. Multi-credential and multi-tenant support are planned for a future major release, and the work in 0.3 is deliberately setting the stage for that evolution without rushing it.

As always, the goal is not to move fast for its own sake, but to build something administrators can rely on when the data matters.

## Feature Recap

## Looking Ahead to 0.4.0

Language localization is planned to make the interface more accessible across regions without altering underlying behavior or terminology. The intent is to localize presentation while keeping operational semantics consistent for admins working across environments.

Managed Preferences support is planned to allow MDM-based deployment of API credentials and certificates. This will enable more consistent and repeatable setup, particularly in environments where ABM Warranty is deployed alongside existing management tooling. Credentials will remain locally stored and securely handled, but configuration will no longer require manual setup on every machine.

The ability to configure and switch between multiple ABM API accounts is also planned. This is particularly important for MSPs and consultants managing multiple Apple Business Manager instances. Each account will maintain its own isolated dataset, with explicit switching rather than blended views, preserving clarity and preventing cross-tenant confusion.

Data completeness handling will continue to be refined. More granular “no data” states are planned, along with the ability to re-fetch individual device records without requiring a full reload. This work is intended to reduce unnecessary API traffic while improving recovery from partial or interrupted imports.

A manual “renewed” state is also planned for device records. This will allow admins to mark devices as renewed locally while waiting for Apple’s backend data to reflect updated coverage, preventing devices from remaining in a warning or “at risk” state longer than necessary.

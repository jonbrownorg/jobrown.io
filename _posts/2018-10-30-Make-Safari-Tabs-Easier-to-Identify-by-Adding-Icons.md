Do you end up with so many tabs in Safari that it becomes impossible to
read the truncated tab titles? There's no shame in that, and Safari
12---which comes with macOS 10.14 Mojave and is a free update for 10.12
Sierra and 10.13 High Sierra---now offers an option to add an icon
representing the Web site to each open tab. Called a *favicon,* this
tiny image is usually carefully designed to identify its site and makes
it easier to pick out the tab. To enable the feature, open Safari \>
Preferences \> Tabs and select "Show website icons in tabs." Unlike
other Web browsers, Safari never shrinks a regular tab to just the icon,
so you'll always see the icon and some text.

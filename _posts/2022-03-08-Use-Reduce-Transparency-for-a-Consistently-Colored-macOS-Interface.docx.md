For years now, Apple has made transparency a part of the macOS
interface, which has the effect of blending the menu bar into the
background and making menus and some windows take on the background hue,
as you can see on the left side of the illustration below. For many
people, transparency blurs the interface, making it harder to
differentiate interface elements from the wallpaper. It also causes
problems for screenshots meant for publication because the images end up
with unrepresentative color levels. To prevent that from happening, open
System Preferences > Accessibility > Display and select Reduce
Transparency. It can be a significant difference, as you can see on the
right side of the illustration below.

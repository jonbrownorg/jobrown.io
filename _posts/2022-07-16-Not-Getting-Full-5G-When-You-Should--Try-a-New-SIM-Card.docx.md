If you've been moving your SIM card from phone to phone over the years,
you might inadvertently be preventing your current phone from taking
full advantage of 5G connectivity. Cellular carriers aren't always
forthcoming about what will and will not work, but at least in the US,
[AT&T](https://forums.att.com/conversations/apple/do-i-need-a-new-sim-card-to-get-5g-when-i-upgrade-my-iphone/5fac14c0ed9970384f9bd23f),
[T-Mobile](https://www.t-mobile.com/support/devices/latest-sim-for-great-network-experience),
and [Verizon](https://www.verizon.com/support/4g-sim-card-faqs/) all
make noises about how you need a 5G-capable SIM card to use the latest
and greatest 5G technologies. The solution is simple: stop by a
carrier's store or contact them to ask for a new SIM. It should be free
and will take just a minute to install once the carrier support people
have configured it to your phone number. Precisely where the SIM card
slot is on your iPhone varies a bit by model; Apple provides [full
instructions](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201337).

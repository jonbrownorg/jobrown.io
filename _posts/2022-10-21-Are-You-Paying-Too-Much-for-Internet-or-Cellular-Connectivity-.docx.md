We've recently worked with a few clients who were paying too much for
their Internet or cellular service. Internet service providers (ISPs)
and cellular carriers occasionally adjust their service plans to account
for new technologies, economies of scale, changing competitive
landscapes, and marketing efforts. Sometimes they'll increase speeds or
capabilities across the board, but more often, when they debut new
plans, current customers are grandfathered into their existing plans,
often without notification. Upgrading to a new, better plan is usually
simple---first, check the plan details on your ISP's or cellular
carrier's website. Then, if they look better or cheaper---or if you
don't remember what service levels you should be getting---call the
company's support line and ask if switching plans would be beneficial.
Beware that they may try to upsell you on a more expensive plan, so
agree to switch only if you'll end up paying less or getting
significantly more. Remember, more speed isn't necessarily
worthwhile---most people won't notice the difference between 250 Mbps
and 1 Gbps, for instance.

Are you among the millions of people planning to get a new iPhone 14?
It's exciting, we know, but don't move too fast when getting started
with your new iPhone, or you might cause yourself headaches. Instead,
follow these instructions once you're ready to transfer your data to the
new iPhone:

1.  Make sure you know your Apple ID and password! You will likely have
    to enter them at least once during this process.

2.  If you have an Apple Watch, it's safest to [unpair it from your old
    iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204568), which
    automatically backs up your Apple Watch. (In theory, [unpairing
    shouldn't always be
    necessary](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205189), but it never
    hurts.)
    
    There are two caveats when unpairing. First, if you have a cellular
    Apple Watch, you'll be asked if you want to keep or remove your
    plan. Assuming that you're keeping your Apple Watch to re-pair with
    your new iPhone, keep the plan. Second, if you use a transit card in
    the Wallet app, Apple recommends [removing your transit
    card](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205583#removecard) from your
    Apple Watch before unpairing.

> Using the Watch app on your old iPhone, go to the My Watch tab, tap
> All Watches (at the top left of the screen), tap the â“˜ button next to
> your Apple Watch, and tap Unpair Apple Watch.

3.  Make a backup of your old iPhone to
    [iCloud](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211228) or your
    [Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211229). (If you back up to
    a Mac, be sure to [encrypt the
    backup](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205220), or else it won't
    include saved passwords, Wi-Fi settings, browsing history, Health
    data, and call history.) Or back up to both, for safety's sake. We
    prefer iCloud backups because they're easier and don't introduce
    additional variables. Apple will even give you [temporary iCloud
    storage](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212732) to make a backup
    when moving to a new iPhone. To initiate an iCloud backup, go to
    Settings > *Your Name* > iCloud > iCloud Backup and tap Back Up
    Now.

4.  You may need to [transfer your SIM
    card](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201337) from your old iPhone
    to your new one. However, that's highly unlikely if you ordered
    through Apple and connected to your cellular carrier account during
    purchase; if you did that, activating the new iPhone should cause it
    to take over your phone number. Even if that isn't the case, it's
    better to contact your carrier and get them to activate the new SIM
    in the new iPhone because old SIMs don't always support all current
    cellular features, such as full 5G support.
    
5.  Transfer your data, settings, apps, and purchased content in one of
    these three ways. None of them will be quick, so do the transfer
    when you have time:

    -   **[Quick Start](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210216):**
        With the Quick Start feature, content from your old iPhone
        copies directly from your old iPhone to your new one. We
        recommend this technique because it generally preserves app
        logins, something that's less true when restoring from an iCloud
        backup. Put your iPhones next to each other (and plugged into
        power), use the old iPhone to scan the animation on the new one,
        and then follow the rest of the steps.
        <img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2022/20220905Re/image4.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />
    -   **[iCloud](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210217):** With
        this technique, the new iPhone will download your content from
        your old iPhone's iCloud backup. Once you've joined a Wi-Fi
        network on the new iPhone and tapped the Restore from iCloud
        Backup button, you'll have to select the correct backup---likely
        the most recent one you just made. Keep your new iPhone plugged
        into power the entire time to ensure that all your content syncs
        during this step.
    -   **[Finder or
        iTunes](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210218):** With this
        approach, you'll restore your old iPhone's content from a backup
        made to your Mac. Connect your new iPhone to your Mac using an
        appropriate cable, open a Finder window (or iTunes on an old
        Mac), select your device, click Restore Backup, and choose the
        appropriate backup---likely the most recent one.


6.  Perform [post-transfer
    tasks](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209568). Ensure that you
    can make and receive a phone call. [Pair your Apple
    Watch](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204505) with the new iPhone
    if necessary. You'll also need to [pair your Bluetooth
    accessories](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204091)---including
    [AirPods](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207010)---with your new
    iPhone. Plus, some app data needs to sync to your new iPhone, so
    open the Mail, Contacts, and Calendar apps and check if they have
    your data. It could take a few minutes for them to fill up. Apps may
    ask for notification permissions again, and you may need to download
    content and in-app purchases.

7.  Finally, and this post-transfer task is becoming increasingly
    important, if you use two-factor authentication with an app like
    [1Password](https://support.1password.com/one-time-passwords/),
    [Authy](https://authy.com/), or [Google
    Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform=iOS&oco=0),
    make sure that you can get your 2FA codes using your new iPhone.
    1Password and Authy should be good about providing access to your
    2FA codes from multiple devices---just log in to your account from
    each device---but Google Authenticator may require [some additional
    setup](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform=iOS&oco=0)
    since it didn't originally offer any way to transfer codes to a new
    phone or among multiple devices.

Although Apple works hard to make the process of transferring from an
old iPhone to a new one as painless as possible, some things may fail to
transfer seamlessly. For that reason, we strongly recommend holding onto
your old iPhone for a week or so to ensure the new one can do everything
the old one could. During that time, put the new iPhone through its
paces with an eye toward checking every app you need.

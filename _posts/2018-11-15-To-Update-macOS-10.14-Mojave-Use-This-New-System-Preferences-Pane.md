For years, you've used the App Store app to install operating system and
app updates on your Mac. That's still true for apps, but with macOS
10.14 Mojave, Apple moved operating system updates to the new Software
Update preference pane, which replaces the old App Store preference
pane. Open System Preferences \> Software Update to check your version
of macOS and access available updates---there will be an Update Now
button to click. You should also visit this pane to tell your Mac how to
best handle system and app updates: Don't select "Automatically keep my
Mac up to date" because updates might come at an inconvenient time for
you. Instead, click Advanced and then select "Check for updates" and
"Install system data files and security updates"---they're important.
Unless you're low on drive space, selecting "Download new updates when
available" is fine, since that will make updating faster. However, keep
"Install macOS updates" and "Install app updates from the App Store" off
so you can choose when to update.

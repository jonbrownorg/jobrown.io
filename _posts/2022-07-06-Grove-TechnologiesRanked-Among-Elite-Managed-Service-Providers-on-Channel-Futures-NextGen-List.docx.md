**About Grove Technologies**

Grove Technologies was founded in 2014 with the goal of taking Mac-based
businesses to the next level. Since then we have partnered with hundreds
of clients across the US to do just that. We solve major challenges like
Mac deployment and MDM, while taking the time to learn the needs of our
individual businesses. In addition to our personalized service, we feel
that our core values set us apart from our competition. We fully embrace
the concept of radical transparency and treat our employees as
first-class citizens which means that everyone feels like a valued
member of the company tied to the overall success of what we are trying
to accomplish. This "all in this together" mentality extends to our
client relationships as well further strengthening the trust that they
have in us. If you are looking for a new kind of MSP, one that is more
about building relationships than profits, I urge you to check out Grove
Technologies and see what we can do for you!

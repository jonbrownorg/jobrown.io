Whenever you tap a link to open a Web page on your iPhone or iPad, it
automatically opens a new tab. Having hundreds of tabs open won't cause
any problems but can make working with tabs clumsy. You can close all
tabs---touch and hold the tab button and then tap Close All X Tabs---but
you might prefer to prevent them from building up in the first place. To
do that in iOS 13, navigate to Settings > Safari > Close Tabs and
choose from Manually, After One Day, After One Week, or After One Month.

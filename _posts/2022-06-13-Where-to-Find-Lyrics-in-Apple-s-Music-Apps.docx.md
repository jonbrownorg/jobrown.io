It's often tough to figure out exactly what a singer is saying (which
can lead to [some amusing mistakes](https://www.kissthisguy.com/)), but
for many songs in Apple Music, you can bring up full lyrics in the Music
app, regardless of which device you're using. On the Mac, click the
speech balloon button in the upper-right corner to display the lyrics
pane on the right side of the window. On an iPhone, tap the playback
controls at the bottom of the screen to bring up the Now Playing view,
then tap the speech balloon button in the lower-left corner to show
lyrics. Music on the iPad is similar to the iPhone, but the speech
balloon button is on the right side. With many songs, the lyrics will
scroll as the song plays, but with others, you'll just get a static
display. Either way, you'll know that the ants, my friends, are not
blowin' in the wind.

We wanted to make sure that those of you who work on a Mac laptop with
an external display know that you can close your laptop's screen and
keep working. Apple calls this *closed-clamshell* or *closed-display
mode.* Of course, it requires that you connect an external keyboard and
mouse or trackpad, via either USB or Bluetooth, and the laptop should be
connected to power as well. Apple also recommends putting the Mac to
sleep before disconnecting the external display. Why would you want to
use closed-display mode? Mostly to conserve desk space when you have
another preferred keyboard and pointing device, although it might also
help graphics performance by allowing the Mac to focus on driving only
the external display. There are lots of stands that hold a MacBook in a
vertical orientation so it takes up less desk space.

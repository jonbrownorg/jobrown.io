Let's be honest---text editing in iOS has never been anywhere near as
good as it is on the Mac. We may be more accustomed to our mice and
keyboards, but the Multi-Touch interface has always been clumsy when it
comes to text. Apple keeps trying to improve iOS's text editing
features, and iOS 13 (and iPadOS 13) brings some welcome changes in how
we go about positioning the text insertion point, selecting text, and
performing the familiar options in the Mac's Edit menu: Cut, Copy,
Paste, and Undo/Redo. Has it caught up with the Mac yet? You'll have to
decide that for yourself, once you've learned the new techniques.

Note that these changes apply only to spots in iOS where you're entering
and editing text, not selecting and copying static, read-only text such
as a Web page in Safari. And even when you are working on a Web page
where you can enter and edit text, the site may override iOS's text
handling.​

**Insertion Point Positioning**

Positioning the insertion point on the Mac is easy---you move the cursor
to the right spot and click. In previous versions of iOS, you could tap
to put the insertion point at the start or end of a word, or press and
hold briefly to bring up a magnifying glass that let you put the
insertion point anywhere, including within a word. It was slow and
awkward, and made better mostly by trackpad mode, which you could invoke
by long-pressing the Space bar.

iOS 13 improves positioning by letting you press and hold the insertion
point to pick it up and then drag it to where you want it. This approach
is much easier and more sensible than the previous method.

**Selecting Text**

On the Mac, you can select text with multiple clicks, by clicking and
dragging, or by using the keyboard. In iOS, however, text selection has
always been tough---you could double-tap to select a word, but anything
else required subsequent moving of start and end markers. (On an iPad
with a keyboard, you could hold Shift and use the arrow keys too.)

Happily, iOS 13 improves text selection. To start, you can still
double-tap to select a word, but you can also triple-tap to select a
sentence (shown below) and even tap four times in quick succession to
select an entire paragraph. Unfortunately, these selection shortcuts may
not work in all apps, but you can always fall back on the previous
approach.

For selections of an arbitrary length, just press, pause ever so briefly
to start selecting, and then drag to extend the selection. In other
words, it's as close to the Mac approach as is possible with the
Multi-Touch interface. If the selection isn't quite right, you can
adjust the start and end markers.​

**Cut, Copy, Paste, and Undo Gestures**

Everyone knows Command-X for Cut, Command-C for Copy, Command-V for
Paste, and Command-Z for Undo on the Mac. In previous versions of iOS,
those commands were available only from a popover that appeared when
text was selected, or (for Paste) when you pressed and held in a text
area. The only command with a gesture, so to speak, was Undo. At the
risk of dropping it, you could shake your iOS device to undo your last
action. Not good.

iOS 13 introduces a variety of three-finger gestures to make these
commands quick and easy to invoke. Note that you can use the entire
screen for these gestures---it's OK to make them with one finger over
the keyboard.

-   **Copy:** To copy selected text, pinch in with
    three fingers, or, more likely, your thumb, index finger, and middle
    finger.
-   **Cut:** To cut (copy and then delete) selected
    text, perform the copy gesture twice in quick succession.
-   **Paste:** To paste the text you've copied at
    the insertion point, reverse the action---pinching out (spreading)
    with three fingers.
-   **Undo:** To undo a mistake, immediately swipe
    left or tap twice with three fingers. You can keep swiping or
    double-tapping to undo more actions.
-   **Redo:** To redo the action that you just
    undid, swipe right with three fingers.

Whenever you use one of these gestures, a little feedback badge appears
at the top of the screen to reinforce what you just did.

If you can't remember which direction to pinch or swipe, press and hold
with three fingers anywhere for a second to see a shortcut bar at the
top of the screen with icons for Undo, Cut, Copy, Paste, and Redo.

Finally, instead of using Cut and Paste to move a swath of selected
text, try dragging it to the new position.​

**Slide to Type**

Various third-party keyboards have provided "slide-to-type" over the
years, letting you type a word by sliding your finger from letter to
letter on the keyboard without lifting it up in between. But switching
to a third-party keyboard meant that you often gave up useful other
features, like Siri dictation, so most people stuck with Apple's default
keyboard.

On the iPhone, iOS 13 now lets you slide to type on its default
keyboard, and it works surprisingly well. In iPadOS 13, slide-to-type
works only on the new floating keyboard you can get by pinching with two
fingers on the default keyboard (pinch out with two fingers to restore
the default keyboard). When you get to the end of a word, lift your
finger to insert it, and then start sliding again for the next word. If
you make a mistake, the suggestions above the keyboard often provide the
word you want. You can switch between tapping (best for unusual words)
and sliding on a word-by-word basis.

Make a mistake with sliding? By default, tap Delete after inserting a
slide-to-type word to delete the whole word, not just the final letter.
If you don't like that behavior, turn off Delete Slide-to-Type by Word
in Settings \> General \> Keyboard.

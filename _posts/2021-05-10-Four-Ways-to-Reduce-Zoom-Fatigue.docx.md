After a long day of video calls, you might feel like your brain has been
wrung out like a wet washcloth---we certainly do. It's exhausting to
stare into a computer for hours every day while participating in
meetings or classes. This condition is called *Zoom fatigue*, and it's a
recent affliction for most of us because the pandemic has dramatically
increased the popularity of video calls. We don't mean to beat on Zoom
here---this condition plagues people who use Cisco WebEx, FaceTime,
Google Hangouts, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, Skype, and other
videoconferencing software too.

But there are techniques you can employ to reduce Zoom fatigue.
Researchers at Stanford University have identified [four reasons why
video calls are so
tiring](https://news.stanford.edu/2021/02/23/four-causes-zoom-fatigue-solutions/)
and offer suggestions on making them less so. They include:

-   **Close-up eye contact is overwhelming.** You usually sit about an
    arm's length from your computer display, and if one person is on
    screen at a time, their head may be close to life-size. You'd never
    be that near someone's face in real life unless they were a close
    family member, and even then, you wouldn't hold that position for
    long. *Shrink your window or switch to gallery view so you're
    talking to postage stamps rather than feeling like someone is up in
    your face.*

-   **Looking at yourself is psychologically harmful.** We all have
    mirrors, but can you imagine staring into one for hours every day?
    Only a pathological narcissist would do that. Worse, constantly
    seeing your own image can make you worry about your appearance and
    what others think of you. *Once you've verified that you're properly
    framed and don't have salad in your teeth, hide your preview or
    switch to a view that doesn't include you.*

-   **Sitting perfectly still is difficult.** This is hardest on kids,
    but even adults have trouble staying sufficiently still to remain
    perfectly framed in a video window. When you're on a standard phone
    call or in an in-person meeting, you might pace around the room or
    at least adjust your position in your chair. *Try turning off your
    camera when possible---most calls work just as well without
    video---or position it so you can fidget or pace in person. Another
    solution is Apple's Center Stage technology on the new M1-based iPad
    Pros, which automatically pans and zooms to keep you in the picture
    as you move around.*

-   **Video calls make you constantly think about call mechanics.**
    There's nothing natural about interacting with multiple people on a
    screen, so we've all come up with behaviors (some of which we just
    recommended!) to smooth over the cracks in the system. For instance,
    your brain has to expend extra effort to help you stay framed in the
    video window, worry about how you look, use exaggerated facial
    expressions so people know you're paying attention, and use
    techniques like a thumbs-up to indicate approval without unmuting.
    *The solution is to turn off your camera and hide the video window
    so your brain can take a break and focus on just the audio content
    of the call.*

You'll notice that most of the recommendations for reducing the mental
strain of video calls come down to eliminating video. It shouldn't be
surprising because talking on the phone isn't nearly as tiring, even
when you're on a conference call with a couple of people. There's no
question that video can help convey information that would be lost in a
phone call, and it's nice to see far-flung friends and family, but
there's no rule that video calls are the best form of communication for
all situations.

We've started to put these recommendations into practice ourselves, and
we encourage you to do so as well. And if you need support for why
you're turning off your camera or asking for audio-only calls, send

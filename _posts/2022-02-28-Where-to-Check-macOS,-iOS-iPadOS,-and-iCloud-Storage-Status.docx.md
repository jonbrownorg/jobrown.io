There's little more frustrating than running out of space, which always
seems to happen at just the wrong time. Luckily, Apple makes it easy to
check any time, before it becomes a problem. On the Mac, choose About
This Mac from the Apple menu and click Storage. On an iPhone or iPad,
navigate to Settings > General > iPhone/iPad Storage. For iCloud, you
can look in either System Preferences > Apple ID on the Mac or in
Settings > *Your Name* > iCloud > Manage Storage on an iPhone or
iPad. Once you know how much space is consumed by what, you can more
easily clear unnecessary data.

Before macOS 12 Monterey, if you wanted to sell, trade in, or give away
your Mac, you had to boot into Recovery, erase the internal drive with
Disk Utility, and reinstall macOS to ensure that the new owner would get
a fresh start and couldn't see any of your data. In Monterey, Apple has
made the process much easier for newer Macs that use Apple silicon or
that are Intel-based with a T2 security chip. Open System Preferences,
and from the System Preferences menu (yes, it has menus), choose Erase
All Content and Settings. You'll have to enter an administrator username
and password to enter the Erase Assistant. It suggests you back up to
Time Machine before erasing, and if you've already done that or don't
want to, click Continue. Verify everything that will be erased on the
next screen and click Continue. Finally, log out of your Apple ID when
prompted to complete the erasure.

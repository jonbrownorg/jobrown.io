To our valued clients,

This is an unprecedented time in our history. The COVID-19 pandemic is having an impact on the health of our loved ones, the businesses we rely upon, the health of the global economy, and the way we live our daily lives. As we all continue to navigate through these unique and evolving challenges, we want you to know that Grove Technologies is still here for your technical support needs.

Currently, there are no cases of the virus reported among employees of Grove Technologies. The safety of our team, families, clients, and partners is our top priority. Following CDC and public health guidance, Grove plans to continue to assist in the transition of offices going completely remote with continued support. You can count on us to continue to do our best serving you. 

> Outlined below are the methods that we recommend you use to reach the team. You can **email** the entire team at any time by sending an email to <a href="mailto:support@grovetech.co" class="link">support@grovetech.co</a>. You can reach a person by **calling** <a onclick="Calendly.initPopupWidget({url: 'https://calendly.com/grove-sales-team/grove-sales-call'});return false;" class="link cursor-pointer">888-253-9103</a> and you can get support over text, by **texting "support"** to <a onclick="Calendly.initPopupWidget({url: 'https://calendly.com/grove-sales-team/grove-sales-call'});return false;" class="link cursor-pointer">1-240-451-8688</a>. 

Our customers rely on chat based forms of support, and texting is a natural extension for support for us here at Grove. Our shared SMS platform allows you to text for support and allows any on call technician to respond within our service window. 

> Our business, like yours, relies upon business continuity. **On that note, we are asking that you refrain from calling or texting our technicians on their personal cell phones.** In the event that a technician falls ill or has to step back from duties it's important that everyone is looped into all work being done and using the above approved methods will ensure that work can be completed by anyone on our team. 

We hope everyone will continue to practice good hand washing techniques and social distancing to help prevent the spread of the virus. While it may be disappointing to hear that so many sports events, cruises, festivals and other gatherings are being cancelled, there is a public health reason for these measures. 

Staying at least six feet away from other people lessens your chances of catching COVID-19. The pandemic can seem overwhelming, but in truth, every person can help slow down the spread of COVID-19. By doing your part, you can make a big difference to your health, and that of others around you.

Thank you for your continued business and support. Hoping you and your loved ones stay healthy.

Take Care!

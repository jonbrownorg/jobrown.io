I love your  your name by the way, Grove Technologies as Grove is a great  concept related to  of course Apple. Nice. That you ended up there. Do you wanna give listeners an overview of that  how you got to this point? Yeah. When I first started, the company really started off by wanting to help businesses that worked in an industry where it was all Apple centric, but I was targeting companies that had one or fewer right IT people.

And the struggle that I always had when I was working in the, as an IT director, as an IT person, I was really the only IT person at and any company that I would ever work for. And it was really hard to just find somebody that could give me a break. I found it really hard to actually take two weeks of vacation.

Yeah. Because my company, they just wouldn't let me take that time off. I tried pairing  with some consultants in the area, but they were mostly PC centric, so I thought maybe I can start a Mac consulting company. So I just  pulled into my brain and reached out and pulled out a name, which happened to be.

Just a terrible name. It was Mac Gurus it was already in use. I had no idea what I was doing. I had no clue. Trademarks, no idea  copyrights. No clue. I'm just gonna go for it. I'm gonna use this name. It worked for a while    until we found out that someone else was using the name. When we had to rebrand until the cease and desist letter came in  , I try not to think about it negatively because when I first picked the name and I applied to be a member of the ACN, I was rejected because I had  the word Mac and the title.

So that role always bummed me out as a diehard Apple fan. I  took it a little personally and then when I realized legally I never should have picked the name anyway,  I look at it now as  like a blessing, not a curse.  We were able to really think strategically about what I wanted the business to become.

I was working for a design agency at the time who was  struggling, and so we worked out the name in trade, so they renamed us and picked the name Grove Technologies. They came up with a logo.  in exchange for services rendered.  And that's  how Grove was born. It's been phenomenal, the growth year over year ever since.

And I think the name and the brand , went  a lot into that. That's very cool.  It's nice how you turned around that kind of  feeling of rejection  having not been able to join the Apple Consultants Network under the original name  and then being able to have this positive outcome.

Unfortunately, having to go through the legal aspect of things, resulting life lesson, it was a good. Yeah, that's a good way to look at it. Yeah, exactly.  You just came out ahead in, in the long run  and  this is a much more kind of scalable name also.

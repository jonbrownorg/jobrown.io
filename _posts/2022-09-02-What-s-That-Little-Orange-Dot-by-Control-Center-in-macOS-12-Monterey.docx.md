Have you noticed a little orange dot next to the icon for Control Center
on the menu bar in macOS 12 Monterey? (And if not, you can't miss it
now.) Apple added that dot to alert you that something is using the
Mac's microphone to listen to the room. Click the Control Center icon to
see which apps are using the mic. In nearly all situations, it will be
entirely innocuous: Siri needs to listen for the "Hey, Siri" trigger, as
in the screenshot below, and the Zoom app needs microphone access to
provide audio in a video call. But if you don't recognize the app that's
listening, you'll want to look into it to make sure there's nothing
creepy going on.

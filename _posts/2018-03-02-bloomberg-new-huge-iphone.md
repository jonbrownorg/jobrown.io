This is part of Apple’s strategy to produce a model for everyone, in 2018 Apple is said to be planning to release 3 new iPhones.

The three iPhones will include an upgraded version of the iPhone X with a screen size of 6.5 inches; the iPhone 9 will feature a 5.8-inch OLED and a cheaper iPhone will be made available with a 6.1-inch LCD display.

All three devices are reported to come with Face ID and edge to edge displays, we can also expect all three devices to have the notch at the top of the screen.

All three devices will also feature a glass back to assist wireless charging although the cheaper iPhone will have aluminium edges rather than stainless steel.

It’s good to see Apple trying for a cheaper iPhone again as they did with the iPhone 5c and iPhone SE as the iPhone 5c introduced many people to iOS.

It would be nice to see less of a differentiation between the cheaper iPhone and the more expensive iPhone and iPhone X plus, I think the big difference in appearance between the iPhone 5c and standard iPhone 5 was a factor in the iPhone 5c not being as successful as was hoped.

The only danger for this very large iPhone in 2018 is that it could start to eat away at iPad sales especially the iPad Mini. Apple may have this covered with the iPad Pro being nearly twice as large as the rumoured 6.5-inch iPhone X plus.

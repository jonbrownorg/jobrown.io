Don't you hate it when a familiar song is playing but you can't think of
what it's called? Or worse, when you hear a new track you really like
but have no one to ask what it is? Never worry about that again, thanks
to your iPhone or iPad. Back in 2018, Apple bought the music
identification app Shazam and has since integrated it into iOS. You can
still use
[Shazam](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shazam-music-discovery/id284993459),
but it's easier to ask Siri, "What's playing?" or tap the Music
Recognition button in Control Center (add it in Settings \> Control
Center) and then let your iPhone listen to the music for a few seconds.
Siri is easiest, but the Control Center button is perfect in situations
where you'd prefer to keep your question quiet. The music recognition
feature recognizes only recorded music---no high school glee club
versions, sorry---and while not perfect, is often helpful. Tap the
notification that appears to open the song in Apple Music.

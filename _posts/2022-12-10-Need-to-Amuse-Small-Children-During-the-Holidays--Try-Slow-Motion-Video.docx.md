If you find yourself at a family gathering with bored children over the
holidays, allow us to recommend an activity that can keep kids engaged.
Figure out something the kids can do that involves motion---knocking
down a tower of blocks, rolling a ball or toy car down stairs, even just
making silly faces---and record them using the Slo-Mo option in the
Camera app. Swipe left (iPhone) or down (iPad) on the viewfinder or
labels to move from Photo mode to Slo-Mo mode, and then tap the red
record button to start filming. Our test kids had fun building tall
towers to knock over while filming, giggled madly while watching the
videos, and went on to brainstorm other activities to film in slow
motion.

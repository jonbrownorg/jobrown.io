In partnership with the US [Centers for Disease
Control](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html){:rel="nofollow"},
Apple has released a free [COVID-19 Screening
Tool](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1504132184){:rel="nofollow"} iOS app and
nearly identical [Web site](https://www.apple.com/covid19/){:rel="nofollow"}. The
interactive screening tool poses a series of questions about symptoms,
risk factors, and recent exposure. Then it offers customized CDC
recommendations, including guidance on social distancing and
self-isolating, how to monitor symptoms, whether or not a test is
recommended, and when to contact a medical provider. In addition, the
app and Web site provide useful information about COVID-19, advice about
how to keep yourself safe, and details on what to expect from testing.
There's nothing here that the CDC and other health agencies haven't
published elsewhere, but the screening tool can provide some peace of
mind and reduce unnecessary load on overworked healthcare providers.

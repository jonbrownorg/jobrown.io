As 2025 begins, it’s a fitting time to reflect on the transformative journey I’ve undertaken over the past few years. It’s been a whirlwind, filled with growth, learning, and exciting challenges.

### 2022: Closing One Chapter

In 2022, I sold the company I had poured my heart and soul into for nearly a decade. For nine and a half years, I ran that business as its CEO, primary consultant, and wearer of every other hat imaginable. Growing the business and eventually selling it was a monumental achievement, but it also marked the beginning of a new chapter.

### Stepping Into Bigger Roles

Leveraging the experience and insights gained from running my own company, I secured an executive role at a much larger consulting firm. This was a significant shift—not only in scale but also in scope. The transition allowed me to gain a broader perspective on the industry while taking on new challenges.

### Entering the Cybersecurity World

After some time, I decided to pivot into a field I had always been tangentially involved in but had never fully immersed myself in: cybersecurity. The move felt like a leap into uncharted territory, yet it also resonated with my desire to keep learning and evolving. Over the course of the year, I earned certifications, gained hands-on experience, and embraced the challenges of this new domain.

### Roles in Review

Reflecting on the past few years, I’ve held four distinct roles:

- **CEO** of my own company
- **Vice President** at a consulting firm
- **Head of Technology**
- **Information Systems Security Officer (ISSO)**

Each position required me to adapt, learn, and grow in ways I hadn’t anticipated. The rapid pace of change was both daunting and invigorating.

### Lessons Learned

One of the most rewarding aspects of this journey has been the opportunity to dive deep into the cybersecurity field, expanding my knowledge and skill set in meaningful ways. This experience has underscored the importance of staying curious, embracing change, and continually challenging oneself.

### Looking Forward to 2025 and Beyond

Despite the years of experience and accomplishments under my belt, I still feel like I’m early in my career. There’s so much more to learn, achieve, and contribute. As I chart my path forward in 2025, I’m motivated by the endless possibilities and the opportunity to grow even further.

### What About You?

While this has been my journey, I’m curious about yours. What has your career path looked like over the past few years? What motivates you to keep pushing forward, and what are your aspirations for 2025 and beyond?

Let’s start a conversation—after all, our stories and insights can inspire and help each other as we navigate our unique paths.

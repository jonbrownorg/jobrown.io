Most of the time, it's appropriate when an auto-correct feature turns
single and double hash marks into single and double curly quotes.
However, there are times when the curly quotes are awkward for some
reason or actively wrong. For instance, hash marks indicate feet and
inches, as in 5\' 6\". You could attempt to disable the auto-correct
feature or copy and paste a hash mark from some other place, but the
simple fix is to type the hash mark, watch auto-correct change it, and
immediately press Command-Z to revert to the hash mark. We can't
guarantee this will work in all situations, but it's generally
effective.

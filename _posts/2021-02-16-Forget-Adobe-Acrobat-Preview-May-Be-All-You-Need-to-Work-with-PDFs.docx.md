We regularly hear from people who think they need [Adobe Acrobat
DC](https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/acrobat.html) to manipulate PDFs.
Don't misunderstand: Adobe Acrobat is the gold standard, but it's
complicated and expensive---$14.99 per month or as part of Creative
Cloud for $52.99 per month. In contrast, Apple's Preview is easy and
free with macOS. Here are six tasks that people may think require
Acrobat but can easily be accomplished in Preview.​

### Remove and Rearrange or Export Pages

Have a PDF with unnecessary pages? You can delete them in Preview.
First, make sure page thumbnails are showing in the sidebar by choosing
View > Thumbnails. Then select the pages you want to remove and press
Delete. Choose File > Save when you're done---you'll need to do that
after all the rest of these tasks too.

Rearranging pages also happens in the sidebar---just drag the thumbnails
as needed. If you drag a thumbnail to the Finder, Preview exports the
page as its own PDF file.​

### Merge and Add Pages

What about putting pages from one PDF into another? Preview has your
back there too. Open both PDFs, make sure their sidebars are showing
page thumbnails, and then drag one or more thumbnails from one sidebar
to the other, dropping them between the desired pages in the
destination.

You can also drag a PDF from the Finder into the sidebar to add all its
pages. Or, to take a photo or scan a document and insert it into the
document, Control-click in the sidebar and choose Import from iPhone or
iPad.

### Annotate Text

Let's say someone asks for edits or comments on a PDF. Although you
can't change the text with Preview, you can mark up the document.

-   **Highlight text:** They may give you flashbacks to high school, but
    > Preview provides a handful of colored highlighters, along with
    > underline and strikethrough styles. Choose one from the Highlight
    > menu in the toolbar and then select the desired text.
    > <img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20210202Fo/image3.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="400" />

-   **Add highlight notes:** To ensure that your highlights make sense
    > to others, add notes to them. Control-click the highlighted text
    > and choose Add Note. Then enter your note in the colored box that
    > appears. It shrinks when you click away from it and expands when
    > you click it again.
    > <img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20210202Fo/image4.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="400" />


-   **Add general notes:** You can also place faux sticky notes anywhere
    > on a PDF page. Reveal the Markup toolbar by clicking the Markup
    > button, and then click the Note button. Dag the closed note box to
    > position it on the page. See all your notes in the sidebar by
    > choosing View > Highlights and Notes.
    > <img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20210202Fo/image5.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="400" />


-   **Add shapes and text boxes:** The Markup toolbar also contains
    > controls for creating various shapes (including lines with arrows)
    > and text boxes. At times, the best way to show what you mean is to
    > put a box, line, or text directly on the page. Click a shape to
    > add it---text you type while it's selected sticks with the shape,
    > like the speech balloon below and the arrows above.
    > <img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20210202Fo/image6.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="400" />


If you do need to edit the text of a PDF, that's a job for Adobe Acrobat
or another PDF tool like Smile's [PDFpen](https://pdfpen.com/pdfpen/).

### Redact Text

Sometimes, when you're sharing a PDF, you want to redact sensitive
information so it can't be read. macOS 11 Big Sur's version of Preview
can permanently obscure and delete selected text from the document.
Choose Tools > Redact and select the text you want to hide.

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20210202Fo/image7.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />


In earlier versions of macOS, you can simulate redaction by covering
text with a colored rectangle. Unfortunately, recipients could delete
your rectangle or copy the text underneath it. Don't depend on this
workaround to protect confidential information. For true redaction in
older versions of macOS, use Acrobat or PDFpen.

### Fill PDF Forms

Although Preview cannot create fillable PDF forms (again, turn to
Acrobat or Smile's [PDFpenPro](https://pdfpen.com/pdfpenpro/)), it works
fine for entering information into such forms. If you have to fill out
an IRS form for your employer, for instance, Preview should work fine.
Just click in a field and type, or click a checkbox to select it.

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20210202Fo/image8.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />


One warning. We've heard occasional reports that Windows users reading
PDFs with forms filled out in Preview sometimes don't see the entered
text. When returning an important form, it's always best to ask the
recipient to confirm that it worked. If it doesn't, fall back on the
free [Adobe Acrobat Reader DC](https://get.adobe.com/reader/).​

### Sign Documents

Now that so much paperwork has gone digital, we often need to sign PDFs.
The most important documents will probably use a service like
[SignEasy](https://signeasy.com/) that's designed for collecting legally
binding, secure signatures. But for something like a simple permit
application, you can add your signature in Preview by clicking the
Signature button in the Markup toolbar and choosing it.

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20210202Fo/image9.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />

Inserting (and resizing) an already created signature is easy, as is the
one-time process of making one. Click the Signature button, and then
click Create Signature. If your Mac has a trackpad, write on it with
your finger or a rubber-tipped iPad stylus. Or use a marker to write
your signature on paper and take a picture of it with the camera. In
macOS 10.15 Catalina and later, you can also create a signature on an
iPhone or iPad. Once created, the signature sticks around in Preview and
even syncs to your other Macs through iCloud.

Note that Preview's signature is just a graphic that could be copied, so
it's no more protected than a handwritten signature that could be
scanned or photocopied.

Useful as all these features are, they're just the tip of the iceberg
when it comes to what Preview can do, particularly with graphics. For a

Continuing its pandemic-driven approach of short, focused announcements,
Apple once again took to the Internet to stream its "One More Thing"
event. On center stage this time was the Mac, or specifically, three
Macs, all of which replace the longstanding Intel chip with Apple's new
M1 chip. All three Macs can be ordered now and will be available within
a week or so.

### What Is the M1 and Why Should You Care?

Before we talk about the Macs that are now based on [Apple's
custom-designed M1 chip](https://www.apple.com/mac/m1/),
let's explain what it is and why it's important.

First, the M1 is what's called a "System on a Chip" or "SoC." Instead of
having a separate CPU (main processor), GPU (graphics processor), and
RAM (memory, which both the CPU and GPU need), the M1 combines those
components onto a single chip. The M1 also has a special 16-core
processor, called the Neural Engine, that helps with machine-learning
tasks, along with a custom storage controller, image signal processor,
and Secure Enclave.

Within the 8-core CPU, Apple has four high-performance cores and four
high-efficiency cores. When you need maximum processing power to edit a
video, for instance, macOS dynamically brings the high-performance cores
into play. However, if you're just reading email, macOS switches to the
high-efficiency cores to avoid wasting power and draining laptop
batteries. Another way the M1 achieves its performance gains is through
"unified memory." By putting the RAM on the chip and sharing it among
the CPU, GPU, and Neural Engine, those processors can access it more
quickly than when it's elsewhere on the motherboard. The downside is
that the M1 chip comes with only 8 GB or 16 GB of RAM; there's no option
for more.

Second, since 2006, Macs have been powered by CPUs from Intel. Switching
to its own M1 chip benefits Apple in three ways:

-   **Performance:** When Apple moved the Mac to Intel chips, it did so
    because IBM's PowerPC chips couldn't compete in performance per
    watt. That measurement is key for battery-powered laptops and has
    come home to roost again. With the M1, Apple has customized the
    design in many ways to provide up to three times the performance per
    watt.

-   **Control:** By designing its own chip, Apple can optimize
    performance in all sorts of small ways that integrate perfectly with
    macOS. Previously, Apple had to work with whatever Intel shipped,
    forcing Apple to make trade-offs in macOS. Plus, Intel's roadmap and
    production schedule often conflicted with Apple's.

-   **Profit:** Apple won't say this, but Intel processors have high
    profit margins, and Apple would far prefer to keep that money rather
    than giving it to Intel.

In essence, the M1 will enable Apple to make Macs that are faster and
cheaper, and that have better battery life. It will also allow Macs to
run all iPhone and iPad apps, since the M1 is similar to the A-series
chips that power those devices.

The first three Macs to take advantage of the M1 are the MacBook Air,
13-inch MacBook Pro, and Mac mini. Apart from a few small exceptions,
the main thing that has changed about these Macs is the M1 chip. They
look the same, feel the same, and work the same, although they do all
come with---and require---macOS 11 Big Sur.

### MacBook Air

The new M1-based [MacBook
Air](https://www.apple.com/macbook-air/) confidently
replaces the previous Intel-based model that Apple released in March
2020. It does so thanks to massive M1-powered performance improvements:
up to 3.5x faster processing, up to 5x faster graphics, and up to 9x
faster machine-learning workloads. The M1's integrated storage
controller and the latest solid-state storage technology also combine
for up to 2x speedier SSD performance.

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20201111Ap/image3.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />

Because the M1 is so much more efficient than Intel chips, the MacBook
Air no longer needs a fan to keep its cool. It's now silent. Apple
significantly improved battery life as well, promising up to 15 hours of
"wireless web" and up to 18 hours of video playback, up from 11 and 12
hours for the previous model. More relevant is that videoconferencing
should last twice as long on a single charge.

There are a few other small improvements:

-   Support for P3 wide color on the 13-inch Retina display

-   Two Thunderbolt 3 ports that support the new USB 4

-   802.11ax Wi-Fi 6 networking, up from 802.11ac Wi-Fi 5

-   Better image quality on the (unchanged) 720p FaceTime HD camera,
    thanks to the M1's dedicated image signal processor

-   Instant wake from sleep

Note that the MacBook Air lacks the Touch Bar of the MacBook Pro---which
may be a pro or a con---but its Magic Keyboard does include traditional
F-keys and a Touch ID sensor for login and authentication.

The MacBook Air comes in two configurations: a low-end model whose M1
chip has an 8-core CPU and a 7-core GPU, plus 8 GB of unified memory and
256 GB of storage for \$999. The high-end model switches to an 8-core
GPU and 512 GB of storage for \$1249---that's \$50 cheaper than the
previous high-end model. You can bump the RAM to 16 GB for \$200, and
the storage levels include 256 GB, 512 GB, 1 TB, and 2 TB.

Frankly, it's a great machine.

### 13-inch MacBook Pro

Things get a little more confusing with the M1-based [13-inch MacBook
Pro](https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro-13/). Previously,
there were four configurations, priced at \$1299, \$1499, \$1799, and
\$1999. Apple replaced the bottom two with M1 configurations but left
the top two with Intel chips. Why? Probably because the higher-end Intel
models can take up to 32 GB of RAM. They also have four Thunderbolt 3
ports and a 4 TB storage option.

Apple doesn't say if or by how much the new M1 MacBook Pro is faster
than the Intel models, but it does say that it's up to 2.8x faster
overall than what it replaces, has up to 5x faster graphics, and is up
to 11x quicker for machine-learning tasks. It should outperform the M1
MacBook Air, even though they share the same chip, because the 13-inch
MacBook Pro has a fan that lets the M1 chip run faster and thus hotter
than in the MacBook Air. Nonetheless, battery life is excellent, with up
to 17 hours of "wireless web" and up to 20 hours of video playback---the
longest battery life ever for a Mac.

The M1 MacBook Pro shares most of the small improvements in the MacBook
Air, including the two Thunderbolt 3/USB 4 ports, 802.11ax Wi-Fi 6,
better image quality from the 720p FaceTime HD camera, and instant wake.
New is a "studio-quality three-mic array" that promises better audio for
videoconferencing. It already supported P3 wide color, and the Retina
display remains gorgeous.

The M1-based 13-inch MacBook Pro starts at \$1299 with an M1 chip that
has an 8-core CPU, 8-core GPU, 8 GB of memory, and 256 GB of storage.
Going to 16 GB of RAM costs \$200, and you can upgrade the storage to
512 GB (\$200), 1 TB (\$700), or 2 TB (\$800).

It can be hard to choose between the MacBook Air and the 13-inch MacBook
Pro. Our take? Pick the MacBook Air for its lower price, fanless design,
and F-keys, or go with the MacBook Pro if you're willing to pay for more
performance and a Touch Bar.

### Mac mini

The third Mac model to switch to the M1 chip is the [Mac
mini](https://www.apple.com/mac-mini/). Like the 13-inch
MacBook Pro, not all models make the jump, however. Previously, there
were two Mac mini models, one starting at \$799 and the other at \$1099.
The M1 Mac mini replaces the low-end model and drops the price to \$699.

As with the other two M1-based Macs, the M1 Mac mini boasts impressive
performance improvements. Apple says its CPU performance is 3x faster
than the model it replaces, it has up to 6x faster graphics, and
machine-learning tasks complete up to 15x faster.

<img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2020/20201111Ap/image5.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />

Although Apple made no comparisons with the remaining Intel-based Mac
mini, we suspect the M1 model will be faster, and it has the new
802.11ax Wi-Fi 6. So why is that Intel Mac mini sticking around?

-   The M1 Mac mini offers only 8 GB or 16 GB (\$200) of RAM, whereas
    the Intel Mac mini is configurable to 32 GB (\$600) or 64 GB
    (\$1000) as well.

-   The Intel Mac mini can drive up to three displays, whereas the M1
    Mac mini supports only two. On the plus side, the M1 Mac mini can
    drive Apple's 6K Pro Display XDR at full resolution, which the Intel
    Mac mini can't.

-   The M1 Mac mini has only two Thunderbolt ports, whereas the Intel
    Mac mini has four.

-   The Intel Mac mini has a \$100 option for 10 Gigabit Ethernet,
    whereas the M1 Mac mini is limited to Gigabit Ethernet.

Our feeling is that, at \$200 cheaper, a comparable M1 Mac mini is a
better deal unless you need any of the hardware options that exist
solely on the Intel Mac mini.

### macOS Big Sur on November 12th

Finally, Apple said that it would release [macOS 11 Big
Sur](https://www.apple.com/macos/big-sur/) on November
12th. The new Macs require it, but put bluntly, we strongly recommend
that you do not upgrade any other production Macs to Big Sur yet. Along
with a complete user interface overhaul, it has significant
under-the-hood changes that could pose compatibility problems for many
workflows in the near term. We'll be evaluating Big Sur with common
productivity apps shortly and will update our advice about when it's
safe to upgrade as we learn more.

In previous versions of iOS, you could change the systemwide text size
to make all apps---at least those that support Dynamic Type---display
text at larger or smaller sizes. (Most people who use this feature want
the text larger so it's easier to read with aging eyes.) In iOS 15 and
iPadOS 15, however, Apple lets you adjust the text size on a per-app
basis, so you can increase it only for those apps where it really makes
a difference for you. First, make sure Text Size is showing in Control
Center by going to Settings \> Control Center, and if it's not in
Included Controls, tap the green + button for it under More Controls.
Then, while in an app where you want bigger text, invoke Control Center,
tap the Text Size button, move the vertical slider to the desired
setting, and then tap the *App* Only button so the setting affects only
that app, not all apps.

## Seriously Cool Features of macOS 10.14 Mojave You Won't Want to Miss
---

With last year's macOS 10.13 High Sierra, Apple made no sweeping
changes, instead focusing on refinements and bug fixes. In keeping with
the company's alternating cycle of releases, this year's macOS 10.14
Mojave boasts plenty of new features.

### Dark Mode and Dynamic Desktop
---
In a major visual change, Mojave features a new Dark mode that reverses
the standard black-on-white look with light gray text on a dark
background throughout the interface---change it in System Preferences \>
General. If your eyes find white window backgrounds too bright, Dark
mode will be a boon. Or, if the current bright approach doesn't bother
you, Dark mode may seem muddy and hard to read because of its reduced
contrast.

Dark mode may be useful, but Dynamic Desktop is just eye candy. Select
either Mojave or Solar Gradients in System Preferences \> Desktop &
Screen Saver \> Desktop, and your wallpaper will change throughout the
day.

### Finder Stacks and Groups
---
Turning to more practical changes, Mojave's Finder boasts a few new
features to help you better navigate a cluttered Desktop and overflowing
folders. Control-click the Desktop and choose Use Stacks, and the Finder
will combine all the related icons on your Desktop into *stacks*. It
collects them by kind by default, but you can instead have it group them
by various dates or even by tags. Click a stack to see what's inside.

Groups are like Stacks, but within a Finder window. With a Finder window
open, choose View \> Use Groups, and note that you can use the View \>
Group By submenu to change the grouping from kind to application, date,
size, and tag.

### Quick Actions in the Finder and Quick Look
---
The Finder's new tricks go even further, with Quick Actions. Controlled
in System Preferences \> Extensions \> Finder, these quick actions let
you rotate or mark up a document within the Finder's preview pane or a
Quick Look window (select a file and press the Space bar). Other quick
actions let you create PDFs and trim video.

Most useful of these is the Markup quick action, which gives you most of
Preview's editing tools---cropping, annotating, and more---right in a
Finder or Quick Look window.

### Still and Video Screen Captures, with Editing
---
Markup also features prominently in Mojave's new screen capture
interface. You've long been able to press Command-Shift-3 for a
screenshot of the entire screen and Command-Shift-4 for a portion of the
screen. Now, press Command-Shift-5 for an interface to those
capabilities, plus video screen recording, which was also possible
before with QuickTime Player.

These capabilities may not be new, but they're a lot easier to use in
Mojave, and there are a few new options, such as being able to keep the
same size selection across multiple screen captures and include the
pointer in screenshots.

### Continuity Camera with iPhone!
---
Have you ever wanted to insert a photo or scanned page into an email
message or document? Mojave makes this easier with Continuity Camera, a
feature that lets you use your iPhone within a Mac app. In Mail, for
instance, start a new message, and then choose File \> Insert from
iPhone \> Take Photo/Scan Documents. Either way, your iPhone immediately
switches to the appropriate photo or scanning mode, and the resulting
photo or scan lands in your message.

### iOS Apps: News, Stocks, Voice Memos, Home
---
Apple has been emphatic that it is *not* planning to retire macOS in
favor of iOS. However, the company does want to make it easier for
developers to write apps that run in both operating systems. As the
first phase of that strategy, Apple has ported four iOS apps to the Mac:
News, Stocks, Voice Memos, and Home.

They look a little different from their iOS cousins, as they should, but
they work similarly, and you can sync their settings and data between
your devices via iCloud (look in System Preferences \> iCloud on the Mac
and in Settings \> *Your Name* \> iCloud in iOS).

There are a variety of other small changes throughout Mojave and in
Apple's standard apps, and we'll share more of those in future posts, so
stay tuned!

### New $329 iPad offers Apple Pencil Support, Powerful A10 Fusion Processor and Educa-tional Discounts

#### Last week, Apple debuted its latest iPad model with powerful capabilities and keeping its promise of deliv-ering a budget tablet.

At its "Let's Take a Field Trip" event held last Tuesday at a local Chicago public school, Apple premiered its newest, sixth generation 9.7 inch iPad model. The new model starts at $329 for the 32GB model, but schools benefit from educational discounts to purchase at $299 each.

### Apple Pencil Support
The new iPad is the first iPad model outside the Pro series to support the Apple Pencil. This is very useful for writing and drawing similar to using pencils and pens. This makes the new model more attractive to educational institutions, schools and students who are on the lookout for af-fordable tablets with drawing and writing capabilities. The Apple Pencil is still an add-on and re-tails at $99.

Heads up! If you're using an older 15-inch MacBook Pro---the version
with lots of ports that predates the current Thunderbolt 3
models---[Apple has started a recall
program](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/06/important-notice-for-batteries-in-certain-macbook-pro-units/){:rel="nofollow"} to
replace batteries that could explode and catch on fire. ([We're not
kidding.](https://twitter.com/whitepanda/status/1133847982317723648){:rel="nofollow"})
The affected MacBook Pro models were sold primarily between September
2015 and February 2017. To find out if your 15-inch MacBook Pro is
affected, [enter its serial number into Apple's recall
page](https://support.apple.com/15-inch-macbook-pro-battery-recall){:rel="nofollow"}.
If it is included in the recall, shut it down and stop using it
immediately! Contact Apple for a free battery replacement, and if you
need any assistance, don't hesitate to get in touch with us.

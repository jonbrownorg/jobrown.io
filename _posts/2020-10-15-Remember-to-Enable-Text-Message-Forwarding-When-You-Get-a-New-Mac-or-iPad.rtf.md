You've long had text messages forwarding from your iPhone to your Mac
and iPad, but after you get a new device, it might be a while before you
realize that it's not receiving texts sent to your iPhone. It turns out
that, when you get a new Apple device, you must manually enable it to
receive forwarded texts from your iPhone---the setting is off by
default. On your iPhone, go to Settings > Messages > Text Message
Forwarding, and flip the switches for the new devices.

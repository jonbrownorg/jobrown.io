It just reminds me how much like  the kind of the fear, uncertainty, and doubt plays into this. Mm.     For years and years. I mean thats, been, just  the way the industry responds to this, and I have this maybe self-censoring that kicks in when I'm making like too hard of a sale  and I'm trying to really convince someone.

I think I back off from that and I really don't like to rely on  the fear of it, but this is an example where the fear is very justified. Like the threat is real.  and people need to be convinced of that. And at the same time, it's not an easy solution. It's not like you're just convincing them, just pay me this much  per month.

That's it. You're done. Security's over. It's actually convincing them that they need to care about it  and they need to really pay attention to it and devote some of their mental bandwidth  and time every day and energy to, to dealing with it and really  get invested and take responsibility and also buy the tools or follow our advice and so on.

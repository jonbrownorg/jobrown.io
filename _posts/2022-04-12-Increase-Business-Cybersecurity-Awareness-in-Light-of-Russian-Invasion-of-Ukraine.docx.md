For several decades, Russia has targeted a [wide variety of
cyberattacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare_by_Russia) at
countries with which it has had disputes. That includes the United
States and other Western nations, which have recently levied
unprecedented sanctions against Russia after it invaded Ukraine.
[President Biden has
warned](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/21/statement-by-president-biden-on-our-nations-cybersecurity/)
that "Russia could conduct malicious cyber activity against the United
States" in response, encouraging the private sector to increase the
protection of systems and networks. This isn't theoretical---the US
[Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security
Agency](https://www.cisa.gov/shields-up) lists [numerous such
attacks](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/russia) in the last five years.

It's tempting to think that your business is too small or unimportant to
be targeted in a Russian cyberattack. While that may be true of direct
infiltration by individual Russian hackers, many cyberattacks are
carried out indiscriminately by bots---the ultimate is the DDoS
(distributed denial of service) attack that uses compromised computers
and Internet-of-things devices to flood a targeted server or company
with an unmanageable amount of random Internet traffic. Plus, a common
hacking approach is to compromise an account on one seemingly unrelated
system as a stepping stone to another, more secure system.

There's nothing new here---we've been encouraging everyone to take
cybersecurity seriously for years now. But the threat is now more
serious than ever before. So, here's what we suggest---if you need help
with any of this, don't hesitate to contact us.

-   **Be vigilant:** The most common way that hackers gain entry into
    computer systems is through an employee opening a malicious
    attachment or being fooled into entering credentials into a fake
    website. Implement or refresh security awareness training that
    teaches employees how to recognize suspicious email, identify
    phishing attempts, and report appropriately.

-   **Use good password practices:** Make sure that everyone uses
    strong, unique passwords that are created, stored, and entered using
    a password manager. Password managers also identify weak passwords
    and those that have been compromised in security breaches---ask
    everyone to audit their passwords and update any that aren't secure.
    (But there's [no reason to change good passwords
    willy-nilly](https://tidbits.com/2022/03/03/never-change-your-password/).)

-   **Implement 2FA:** Whenever possible, require two-factor
    authentication, which provides extremely strong protection against
    remote intrusion given that a compromised password is no longer
    sufficient.

-   **Keep software up to date:** Install all software and operating
    system updates on all platforms. In its security update notes, Apple
    often says that particular vulnerabilities are actively being
    exploited---it's crucial to install such updates immediately. If you
    use anti-malware software (essential for Windows; less so for
    macOS), keep its signatures current.

-   **Backup regularly:** Ensure that all systems are backed up
    regularly, and for your most important data, make sure backups are
    protected from ransomware encryption by storing them offline or
    using object locking on a cloud storage service. Be sure to test
    your backups regularly as well---backing up is the first step, but
    being able to restore is what's necessary.

-   **Increase monitoring:** Keep a centralized record of all employee
    reports of suspicious behavior to better identify attack patterns
    and targeted systems. Whenever possible, make sure server and
    network device logging is enabled so any incidents can be
    investigated more fully. Turn on any anomaly reporting capabilities
    in backup and other security-related apps.

-   **Plan for the worst:** Develop or revisit business continuity and
    crisis response plans. For instance, discuss how you'd deal with
    losing Internet connectivity, being locked out of key online
    accounts, or having all your data rendered inaccessible by
    ransomware.

There's no reason to panic, but the increased threat from Russian
cyberattacks is a good excuse to focus more attention on digital
security. The Internet makes astonishing things possible, but it also
opens us up to attacks that would previously have been inconceivable.
Stay safe out there.

Spearfishing. It's no longer just a tropical ocean sport that could
provide seafood for dinner. In today's tech world, *spearfishing* is
when someone targets you specifically, usually with the goal of taking
over your online accounts. Once that's done, the attacker will try to
siphon money from your bank account, impersonate you in an attempt to
deceive family or colleagues into sending money, or attempt to ruin your
reputation.

You're probably thinking, "No one would ever target me. I'm not
interesting enough." It is true that the people who should worry the
most about spearfishing attacks are high profile or have a high net
worth, but modern online criminals aren't that fussy. In particular,
they're more likely to go after older people. Why older people? Older
people tend to be relatively well off and less likely to notice the
symptoms of a spearfishing attempt. You should also be concerned if
you're a politician or journalist, have ever been involved in an ugly
divorce or legal battle, or can easily think of people who have it in
for you.

As we've said many times, it's imperative that you use a secure password
manager like [1Password](https://1password.com/){:rel="nofollow"} or
[LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/){:rel="nofollow"} to create, store, and enter
a strong, unique password for each of your online accounts. Plus, we
strongly recommend using two-factor authentication---where you have to
enter a one-time code in addition to your password---on all accounts
that support it, particularly important ones like your email and banking
accounts. But even if you do all that, you may be vulnerable to another
tactic favored by spearfishers---the cell phone SIM takeover.

Here's how it works. Every cell phone, including every iPhone, has
inside it a SIM card that gives it a phone number. Swap that SIM into a
different phone and it will adopt the SIM card's number. The problem is
that support reps at cellular carriers like AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and
Verizon can also move your phone number from one SIM card to another.
That makes it possible for you to lose your iPhone, buy a new one, and
have your phone number associated with the new one. It also lets you
port the phone number to a different carrier, if you wish to switch.

All an attacker has to do is call your cellular provider, pretend to be
you, say that they've lost their iPhone, and ask to have the number
ported to a new device (one they control). It's likely that the support
person will ask a few simple questions to verify your identity, but a
clever attacker will likely know your address and be able to learn
details like your mother's maiden name, first-grade teacher's name, and
favorite color, all thanks to Facebook. Criminals can acquire even
information like your Social Security number through other data
breaches.

Once the attacker controls your cell phone number, they can try to reset
the password on various accounts, receiving any verification codes that
would normally have been texted to your phone. They'll probably focus on
your email account first because, with control over it, they can reset
passwords elsewhere even more easily. And once the attacker has access
to your accounts, it's game over, and you'll be faced with the difficult
and complex task of retaking control and mitigating damage.

How can you protect yourself from such an attack? Whenever possible,
it's better to generate authentication codes with an app such as [1Password](https://1password.com/){:rel="nofollow"},[Authy](https://authy.com/){:rel="nofollow"}, or[LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/){:rel="nofollow"}. 
That removes some of your exposure, but for better or worse, your cell phone number is still
the most basic form of identity for many things.

The most important thing to do, then, is to set up an additional PIN or
passcode that the carrier will ask for before making any changes to your
account. You'll also have to provide it when logging in to your cellular
account online. Such a PIN or passcode is different from a two-factor
authentication code that changes continuously---you set your PIN or
passcode just like you do for your iPhone or ATM card. And, of course,
make sure to store that PIN or passcode in your password manager
alongside your other credentials so you don't forget it.

## Interlaced.io Announces Acquisition of Grove Technologies

## Leading IT Managed Services Provider Adds Innovative, DC IT Group to Business

June 22, 2022

Washington, DC -- Interlaced.io, a leading managed IT services
provider, announced today the acquisition of Grove Technologies, a
high-performing IT Service Provider based in the DC Metro Area. Founded
by [Jon Brown](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonbrown2/) in
2014, Grove has grown to be a staple name in providing services to
Apple-integrated and cybersecurity-focused small businesses.

"Partnering with Jon Brown and the Grove Technologies Team will improve
our ability to bring Interlaced's world-class IT services to innovative
and fast-growing SMBs in the DC Market. We're excited about the strong
Mac-focus and cybersecurity expertise the Grove team brings to the
table. I look forward to seeing our combined capabilities serving both
Grove and Interlaced clients, current and future," said [Jeff
Gaines](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffbgaines/),
President of Interlaced.io.

Grove will continue to operate as a stand-alone brand with close
collaboration and mutual support with Interlaced. This acquisition
serves to deepen the technical and non-technical capabilities available
to both Grove and Interlaced clients across the country. Jon Brown,
Founder of Grove, will remain on staff and continue to oversee the DC
Market, and the rest of the team at Grove Technologies will remain in
their current roles servicing Grove's innovative group of clients.

"This new partnership is going to help us continue to grow and provide
world-class IT support services to our clients. We're really excited to
be backed by such a well established team and brand that can help take
Grove Technologies to the next level," said Brown.

Since iOS 12 and macOS 10.14 Mojave, Apple has supported [Group
FaceTime](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209022), which lets
you have a video call with up to 32 people. However, as has become
painfully obvious in today's era of non-stop videoconferencing, Group
FaceTime has a feature that some find obnoxious: automatic speaking
prominence that causes the video tile for the speaker to grow and move
around. Happily, Apple finally took the feedback and added options to
disable that feature in iOS 13.5, iPadOS 13.5, and macOS 10.15.5
Catalina. In iOS and iPadOS, disable the Speaking option under Automatic
Prominence in Settings \> FaceTime; on the Mac, look in FaceTime \>
Preferences.

We all have things we do regularly on our iPhones, whether it's checking
the weather, searching Google, or invoking the magnifier. Apple has long
provided ways of making your most common actions easier to access. You
might put an app on your Dock, open Control Center, or take advantage of
the triple-press Accessibility shortcut. With iOS 14, Apple has opened
up a new and customizable way of triggering actions: Back
Tap.

With a double or triple tap on the back of any iPhone 8 or newer running
iOS 14, you can invoke any one of a variety of actions, including custom
Shortcuts. Sorry, Back Tap isn't available in iPadOS 14.

Enabling Back Tap is easy, although you might not stumble upon it on
your own. That's because it's technically an accessibility feature for
those who have trouble interacting with the iPhone physically. But just
as curb cuts help both those in wheelchairs and stroller-pushing
parents, the Back Tap feature is a boon for everyone.

Go to Settings > Accessibility > Touch > Back Tap (it's way down at
the bottom), where you can attach actions to both double tap and a
triple tap.

Apple provides a broad set of actions, but most of them are focused on
helping people who can't use other iPhone gestures. So yes, you could
make a double tap open Spotlight for searching, but unless that's
somehow a lot easier than swiping down on the Home screen, it's not
worth one of your two triggers. Actions fall into four categories:

-   **System:** Most of the System choices mimic
    easy Home screen gestures or button presses. Most interesting are
    Mute, which toggles the ringer volume without forcing you to press
    the Volume Down button repeatedly, and Screenshot, which takes a
    picture of your screen without making you press two buttons at once.
-   **Accessibility:** For those who need these
    Accessibility options, having them easily accessible via Back Tap
    will be welcome. The most compelling actions for the general public
    are Magnifier, Speak Screen, and Voice Control. (Voice Control
    provides much more capable dictation than Siri.)
-   **Scroll Gestures:** These options scroll a
    vertically oriented page or screen. Sadly, they don't work for
    horizontally driven page flipping in book reading apps like Libby.
-   **Shortcuts:** Here's where Back Tap becomes
    ultimately useful, at least if you can find or build the necessary
    shortcuts. Anything Shortcuts can do, you can invoke with a double
    or triple tap.

Wait, what's Shortcuts? It's an automation app that Apple includes with
every iPhone. With it, you can chain together multiple actions derived
from iOS capabilities or provided by your apps to create custom
*shortcuts*. Other systems call similar collections of commands *macros*
or *automations* or *workflows.*

Explaining how to build your own shortcuts is a topic for another day,
but you can also download sample shortcuts from Apple's gallery, both to
see how it's done and to use them. For instance, if you tap the Gallery
button in Shortcuts ➊, tap Starter Shortcuts ➋, tap Take a Break ➌, and
tap Add Shortcut ➍, you'll copy the Take a Break shortcut to My
Shortcuts. Then you can assign a double tap in Back Tap to invoke Take a
Break, which sets an alarm for a specified number of minutes and turns
on Do Not Disturb until the alarm goes off.

Give it a try! Back Tap might turn out to be the iOS 14 feature you use
more frequently than any other.

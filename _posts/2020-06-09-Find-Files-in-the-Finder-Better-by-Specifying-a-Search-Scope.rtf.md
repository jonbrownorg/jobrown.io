This isn't about periscopes or mouthwash---when it comes to searching, a
*scope* is the area in which a search takes place. When you use the
Search field in a Finder window to look for files and folders, you have
the choice of two scopes: This Mac or the current folder. You can always
switch the scope after starting the search by clicking the other choice
near the top of the window, but it's easier to set the default search
scope in Finder \> Preferences \> Advanced so it's set right to start.
From the "When performing a search" pop-up menu, choose Search This Mac
to search across all indexed drives, Search the Current Folder to limit
the search to the folder showing when you start the search, or Use the
Previous Search Scope. Most of the time, if you have any idea where the
item you're looking for might be, selecting an enclosing folder and then
searching within it is the best approach.

The new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models feature a camera housing
built into the screen, resulting in a notch like that on the iPhone.
Most developers are updating their apps to ensure that no controls or
menu bar items appear blocked or hidden by the notch, but if you use an
older app that doesn't play nicely with the notch, there's a fix. Quit
the app if it's running, select it in the Finder's Applications folder,
and choose File > Get Info. In the Info window that opens, select
"Scale to fit below built-in camera." The active area of the display
resizes so everything appears below the notch, slightly reducing the
overall screen space. This checkbox won't appear once the app has been
updated to avoid the notch.

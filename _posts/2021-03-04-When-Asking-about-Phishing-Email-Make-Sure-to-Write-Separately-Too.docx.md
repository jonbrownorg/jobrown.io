Sadly, email is not an entirely reliable communications medium, thanks
to spam filters, addressing errors, and server failures. With certain
types of email, it's worth double-checking that a message was seen. One
example of that we see is with reports of phishing email, which
miscreants use to try to trick you into revealing passwords, credit card
info, or other sensitive information. Phishing messages can be tricky to
identify---that's their goal. If you're forwarding a possible phishing
email to us or another trusted technical contact for evaluation,
remember that spam filters often catch such messages, so they may go
unseen. To work around this awkwardness, send a separate message saying
you've forwarded what you think might be a phishing message so the
recipient knows to check their Junk mailbox if need be. It's helpful if
you can include the Subject line of the suspect message.

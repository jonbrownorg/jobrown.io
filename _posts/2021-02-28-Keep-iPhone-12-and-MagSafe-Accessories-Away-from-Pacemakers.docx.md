Remember when we had to keep magnets away from floppy disks to avoid
scrambling them? Modern storage is no longer vulnerable, but magnets and
electromagnetic fields from consumer electronics can interfere with
medical devices, like implanted pacemakers and defibrillators. Although
iPhone 12 models contain more magnets than prior models, Apple says
they're not expected to pose a greater risk of magnetic interference.
However, after a study found that [one pacemaker could be
deactivated](https://www.heartrhythmjournal.com/article/S1547-5271(20)31227-3/fulltext)
by holding an iPhone 12 near it, Apple issued a [support
document](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211900) recommending that
you keep your iPhone 12 and MagSafe accessories more than 6 inches (15
cm) away from your medical device or more than 12 inches (30 cm) away
while wirelessly charging. Better safe than sorry---if you have a
pacemaker, don't put your iPhone or [any other consumer
electronics](https://www.heartrhythmcasereports.com/article/S2214-0271(20)30017-8/fulltext)
in a breast pocket.

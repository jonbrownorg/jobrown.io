Every so often, we encounter someone struggling to find and launch an
app on their Apple Watch because they have trouble seeing and
interacting with the icon-centric grid view layout. If you're in that
camp, there's a better way. In the iPhone's Watch app, tap My Watch at
the bottom, and then tap App View. Then select List View, which provides
an alphabetically sorted, scrolling list of all your apps. From then on,
it's easy to press the Digital Crown to show the apps, turn it to
scroll, and tap an app to launch it.

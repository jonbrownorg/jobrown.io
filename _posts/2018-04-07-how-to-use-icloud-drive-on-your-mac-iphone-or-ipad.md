Apple's iCloud Drive offers you a way to safely and securely store and save your files - from documents to images and videos. iCloud Drive works similar to Dropbox or Box, but has now integrated a lot of new features through iOS 11, allowing you to collabo-rate with others and work using Apple software such as Pages, Keynote and more.

### Set Up: Mac, iPhone and iPad

The first step is to set up your iCloud Drive account if you haven’t already.

On the Mac

Make sure you are running the latest OS version. Upgrade to the latest version if needed.

Turn on iCloud. Go to System Preferences from the apple Menu and click on iCloud. Enter your Apple ID and then choose the services you wish to use.

iCloud comes with free 5GB of storage by default. You can upgrade your plan at an-ytime and even have a shared account if you would like.

You can log into your iCloud account at [www.icloud.com/iclouddrive](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive). You will need to sign in using your Apple ID.

From macOS Sierra onwards, you can have all the files in the Desktop and Documents folders on your Mac stored automatically in iCloud Drive. You can save files right where you usually keep them on your Mac, and they become available on iCloud.com and all your computers and iOS devices.

On iCloud.com, you can use iCloud Drive to upload and download files, share files, delete files, organize files in folders, rename files, and recover recently deleted files. 
To upgrade your plan, visit [https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201238](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201238).

• Create new files and folders from iCloud-enabled apps.

# The Struggles with Certification in the IT Industry

In the IT field, certifications often appear to be the golden ticket and in many cases the fast track to success. They signal expertise, validate skills, and provide a sense of accomplishment. However, the heavy reliance on certifications in the industry brings a host of challenges, and many professionals, like myself, find themselves questioning the value, timing, and necessity of these credentials. 

Lets explore the psychology of certifications, the phenomenon of over-certification, and the impact on career progression, including managerial and mentorship transitions.

## The Psychology of Certifications

Certifications tap into a fundamental human desire: validation. Achieving a certification provides a tangible marker of success, reinforcing a sense of competence and belonging in the industry. It’s a structured way to prove you’re keeping pace with an ever-changing field.

However, this reliance can turn into a cycle of dependency. Especially in a fast paced environment like IT where new elements come out daily as technology shifts and evolves. No one person for example was an expert in AI, but the moment it hit the scene, IT professionals were expected to be overnight experts in the technology. 

The fear of obsolescence or not being "current" enough—drives many to pursue certification after certification. This mindset can lead to burnout or overshadow the true purpose of these credentials: enabling practical application of skills.

## Is Over-Certification a Problem?

Over-certification occurs when professionals accumulate credentials without a clear alignment to their career goals. This often stems from, industry expectations. In the case of IT that is absolutely the case, especially in the cybersecurity field, right now. 

Some roles emphasize certifications as prerequisites, leading individuals to "collect" them rather than focus on mastery. For myself I often narrow in on my choice of certifications based on what I want to be known for rather than what I want to get into. Thats a different mindset that many fail to think about. I often get certified to show what I have experience in rather than cramming for a test in a field I have little exposure to in order to get my foot in the door. I see this often with cybersecurity, many people who take the CISSP exam for example have never actually worked in the cybersecurity space prior to going for the exam, as its often listed as a prerequisite for jobs they are trying to go after. 

In other cases professionals may over-certify to compensate for a perceived lack of competence. Even the most experienced individual can suffer from imposter syndrome where they may feel inadequate in their job role or field despite validation from their peers and even after rising the ranks at their current role. 

Certifications are often viewed as badges of credibility, even if they do not directly translate to job performance. While certifications can boost resumes, they sometimes lead to diminishing returns. Employers may question whether an individual is over-investing in credentials at the expense of practical experience.

## Pivoting Roles: When to Stop Certifying

When transitioning to a new field or role, continuing to pursue certifications in a previous domain can actually prove to be counterproductive. For instance: If you’re moving into project management or leadership, technical certifications may no longer be relevant. Time spent certifying in an outdated skillset could be invested in learning soft skills, strategic thinking, or domain knowledge critical to the new role.

Deciding when to stop certifying depends on your future goals. If your career path leads away from hands-on technical work, it may be better to focus on broader skillsets rather than deepening expertise in a single niche. For me that meant looking at cybersecurity and project management certifications rather than deeply technical system based certifications. 

## Certifications and the Path to Management

Certifications are often associated with technical proficiency, which can unintentionally hinder a shift into managerial roles. Becoming a manager requires:

- Leadership skills.
- Decision-making abilities.
- Emotional intelligence and team dynamics.

Continuing to pursue certifications in technical areas may signal to employers that you’re more interested in individual contribution than leadership. To transition effectively, consider investing in management training, executive education or contributions made in a team setting that highlight your leadership potential.

## Embracing Mentorship: Passing the Torch

For seasoned professionals, there comes a time when the focus shifts from gaining certifications to sharing knowledge. Becoming a mentor allows you to:

- Guide the next generation of tech talent.
- Derive fulfillment from enabling others to succeed.
- Transition away from the constant pressure of staying certified.

Letting go of certifications doesn’t mean that you no longer have what it takes to perform in a specific industry but rather that you are making room for the next generation to get that certification, hone that skill and that you are their to provide support to them as they do so. Think about your past experiences you likely had a manager that allowed you the room and opportunity as you progressed to a mastery state in your field without even knowing about it. 

Even now I am often asking myself what do I want to be known for, what do I want to leave behind in my current role and its not to be known as the person who single handedly solved every problem but rather then person that paved the way for a new way of thinking and opened up the field to new pathways of success for others.

## The Over-Reliance on Certifications in IT

The IT industry’s emphasis on certifications can sometimes overshadow other valuable attributes, such as creativity, problem-solving, and collaboration. While certifications provide a baseline of knowledge, they often fail to measure critical soft skills or adaptability—qualities that are equally important in today’s dynamic workplaces.

One of the primary issues with this overemphasis is that it creates a narrow view of what defines success in IT. Many hiring managers and recruiters place certifications on a pedestal, often using them as gatekeeping tools to filter candidates. While this simplifies the hiring process, it overlooks candidates who may possess exceptional hands-on experience or innovative thinking but lack formal certifications. This reliance can perpetuate a rigid and exclusionary approach to talent acquisition, leaving behind individuals who could bring diverse perspectives to the table.

Certifications rarely measure real-world problem-solving abilities. In IT, many challenges require quick thinking, collaboration across teams, and the ability to adapt to unforeseen circumstances. These are not skills that can be easily quantified or tested through standardized exams. As a result, professionals who excel in dynamic environments may be undervalued in favor of those with a list of certifications but less practical experience.

Another issue lies in the potential stifling of creativity. IT roles often demand innovative solutions to complex problems, whether it’s designing a new system architecture, optimizing a network, or developing a cutting-edge application. When certifications become the primary focus, there is a risk of promoting a checkbox mentality, where professionals prioritize meeting predefined criteria over exploring creative or unconventional approaches. This can lead to a workforce that is highly credentialed but lacks the flexibility and ingenuity needed to drive the industry forward.

## Are Certifications Really Necessary?

Certifications undoubtedly have their place, particularly for roles requiring compliance, security, or specialized technical knowledge. However, the industry must recognize that they are not the sole determinant of success. Hiring managers should:

- Look beyond certifications to assess practical skills.
- Consider diverse paths to expertise, including self-learning, mentorship, and experience.
- Encourage a balance between certification and real-world application.

Certifications can be powerful tools for growth and validation, but they should not define a career. Understanding the psychology behind certifications and evaluating their relevance to your goals is essential. Whether you’re pivoting to a new role, aiming for management, or stepping into mentorship, the key is to align your efforts with your long-term aspirations. After all, true success in tech is not measured by the number of certifications you hold but by the value you bring to your work and the legacy you leave behind.

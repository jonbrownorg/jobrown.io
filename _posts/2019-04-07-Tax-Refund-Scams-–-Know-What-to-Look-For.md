Tis the season!  You're making mental plans with what is hopefully a
generous tax refund and deciding what to do with the surplus of cash
you'll soon have on hand.

Along the way from starting to submitting the paperwork, there are quite
a few roadblocks to be aware of.  Even if you aren't getting a refund,
your personal information is as valuable as the money you're hoping for
to scammers, so be on high alert.  A compromise of this nature can
expose so much personal information from social security number to bank
account detail, and undoing that damage can be timely and expensive.

Before you even get started, be educated and informed in who you trust
with your taxes.  Don't let your guard down because it's the last minute
and you haven't had anything prepared.  You can file an extension to
give yourself more time, and you can also find trustworthy people --
even at the final hour.  The IRS warns of "ghost" tax preparers that are
a high risk for scams and illegal tactics.  This individual is paid to
prepare your taxes but won't sign or identify themselves on paper or
electronically.  They offer to do the work, print it out, then have you
sign it as if you've done the work yourself -- keeping them off the
books and under the radar.  This service runs a high risk of fraud,
illegitimate information being submitted, and a possibility of your
funds being redirected to their account. Never trust someone that you
have not fully vetted or someone who will not take on accountability for
their work.  Even if they come at the recommendation of a friend or
colleague.

The risks don't stop once you've completed your returns.  You've done
the paperwork, submitted everything on time, and now you wait.  And then
one day the phone rings and the other voice identifies themselves as an
employee of the IRS.  You brace yourself, what is wrong? What did you
forget to complete?  You may be informed that your return is ready, and
they need your bank information, or that the money was deposited into
the wrong account.  Or maybe you are being threatened with legal action
from the person on the other end due to your actions.

This is 100% of the time, not a legitimate IRS employee.  Do not give
them any information, do not even engage in the conversation.  The IRS
will not call you for your bank details and they will not make a mistake
that they want you to correct with updated personal details.  Hang up,
and if you are concerned, contact the IRS directly from the information
on their government website.

This topic of taxes, government involvement, and any type of financial
gain or loss puts most people at a heightened level of stress and
responsiveness.  Don't let that give a criminal easy access to your
vulnerabilities.  Always take a moment to get the details, process the
information, and make sure that you are working with legitimate and
trustworthy people.

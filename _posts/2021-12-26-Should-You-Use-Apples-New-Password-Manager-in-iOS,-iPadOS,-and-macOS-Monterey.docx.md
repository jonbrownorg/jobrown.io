We continually recommend that every Apple user rely on a password
manager like [1Password](https://1password.com/) or
[LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/) for creating, managing, and
entering passwords securely. What we haven't encouraged as heavily is
relying on Apple's built-in password management features. Although
they're free, they've been too basic and hard to use over the years,
relying largely on an ancient utility called Keychain Access.

However, with the release of iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and macOS 12 Monterey,
Apple has at long last created a coherent platform-wide interface---the
bluntly named Passwords---for viewing, editing, and deleting passwords
on each of its platforms. You might wonder if you need a separate
password manager anymore. First, let's dispense with two common
scenarios:

-   **Start if you're new to password management:** If you have so far
    resisted adopting a password manager, you should start using
    Passwords on your Apple devices immediately. In all likelihood, you
    already have some login credentials stored there.


-   **Don't switch if you like your password manager:** If you're
    already using another password manager that you like, there's no
    reason to switch to Apple's password manager. It's fine, but it
    doesn't offer any capabilities beyond most independent password
    managers.

Those who are already using a password manager but aren't entirely happy
with it or would prefer not to pay for it face a tougher decision. How
much your password manager is worth to you is a question only you can
answer, but would Apple's Passwords provide the features you need?
Here's what it can do:

-   **Create strong passwords:** Safari suggests strong passwords when
    it detects that you're creating a new login. In iOS and iPadOS, make
    sure Settings > Passwords > AutoFill Passwords > AutoFill
    Passwords is enabled. On the Mac, make sure Safari > Preferences >
    Autofill > User Names and Passwords is selected.

-   **Manage passwords:** To see all your passwords, look in Settings >
    Passwords in iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, and in System Preferences >
    Passwords in Monterey. Tap or click one to view its details; once
    inside, use Edit to make changes. You can delete an unused login
    while editing or from the list. In iOS and iPadOS, swipe left on a
    login and tap Delete; on the Mac, Control-click the login and choose
    Delete.

-   **Sync passwords:** Passwords are most useful when they're
    accessible on all your devices. That will be true as long as
    Settings > *Your Name* > iCloud > Keychain > iCloud Keychain is
    enabled in iOS and iPadOS, and System Preferences > Apple ID >
    iCloud > Keychain is selected on the Mac. And, of course, all your
    devices must be signed in to the same iCloud account.


-   **Autofill passwords:** As long as the autofill settings mentioned
    earlier are active, Safari will offer to autofill passwords when you
    log in to a site whose credentials you've stored. iOS and iPadOS
    apps also support autofill through the keyboard.

-   **Support two-factor authentication (2FA):** This new feature allows
    you to add the setup secret (usually a scanned QR code or manually
    entered key) that enables the creation and automatic entry of 2FA
    codes.
     <img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2021/20211203Sh/image5.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />


-   **Import and export passwords:** In the Passwords preference pane on
    the Mac, you can now import and export passwords, simplifying
    migration.


-   **Report questionable passwords:** We all have passwords that are
    easily guessed or reused on multiple sites---the Passwords interface
    calls out such passwords so you can change them.
     <img alt="Blog Photo" src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2021/20211203Sh/image6.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />


-   **Share passwords:** If you need to share a password with a family
    member or colleague, the Share button lets you do that via AirDrop.
    Passwords are saved into the recipient's keychain directly.


-   **Detect compromised passwords:** Both Settings > Passwords >
    Security Recommendations and System Preferences > Passwords have a
    Detect Compromised Passwords option. Select it to be alerted if any
    of your login credentials are compromised in a site's security
    breach.

That's a solid set of features, and for many people, it will be
sufficient. However, independent password managers like 1Password and
LastPass have evolved over many years and boast very real advantages:

-   **Multiple platforms and Web browsers:** Apple's password management
    features focus on Apple operating systems and Safari. There is an
    iCloud Passwords Chrome extension for Windows, and Web browsers in
    iOS and iPadOS can tie into the system-wide password features. But
    for broad support across platforms and use within browsers other
    than Safari, stick with an independent password manager.


-   **Data beyond Web logins:** Want to store your bank account numbers,
    driver's license, credit cards, vaccination card, and the like in
    your password manager? Many independent password managers support
    secure storage of types of data beyond logins. They also often let
    you leave notes on items and include file attachments---a screenshot
    of a screen summarizing login requirements, for instance.


-   **Families and teams:** Although Apple is inching in this direction
    with the forthcoming Digital Legacy program, in which you can
    specify someone as a Legacy Contact so they can access to your
    iCloud account in the event of your death, the group sharing
    features of independent password managers are much more useful here
    and now. Share key passwords with your spouse or your college-bound
    child to ensure that everyone will have the access they need to
    shared accounts.


-   **One-time password sharing:** 1Password added this feature
    recently, and there are independent sites like
    [1ty.me](https://1ty.me/) and
    [onetimesecret.com](https://onetimesecret.com/) that provide it as
    well. In essence, it lets you securely share a single password with
    anyone else, embedding it in a link that can be viewed only once.
    That prevents passwords from being sent around in email or text
    messages where they could be stolen.

In the end, Apple's new password management features are like so many
other built-in features. They offer the basic capabilities that most
users need while leaving plenty of room for enterprising developers to
offer compelling additional features. Use Apple's Passwords or another
password manager, whichever you prefer. Just don't rely on a simple text
file or physical notebook to manage passwords. It's more work, easily
lost, and far less secure.

Yes please! I can count on one hand the number of times I have been to the Cinema in recent years, while being able to get popcorn without making it myself is appealing I prefer the comfort of my own home to watch a film.

And yes you can watch them on websites that are mostly illegal depending on the country and jurisdiction which you live under, however after you have spent twenty minutes finding the film and 10 minutes downloading malware you have lost valuable viewing time if not your freedom.

Personally I am happy to wait three months to see a film as it allows everyone else to watch it and filter out the bad ones! But some films I know I want to watch fairly soon after release such as any adaptations of J. R. R. Tolkien’s books.

The ability to watch the films in iTunes a few weeks after release would be a huge draw for me back to iTunes, I think the last film I purchased via iTunes is Pineapple Express, that would be around 8 years ago.

The great thing about iTunes is it lets you watch you purchased films easily using any of your Apple devices, be it Apple TV’s , iMacs, iPhones, iPads, or MacBooks. I don’t need to remember any additional usernames and passwords and the quality of the video stream is always top notch.

While it will be a shame to see Cinema chains suffer it is already a minimum of a 30 minute drive to my nearest Cinema and the appeal of sweaty popcorn has waned.

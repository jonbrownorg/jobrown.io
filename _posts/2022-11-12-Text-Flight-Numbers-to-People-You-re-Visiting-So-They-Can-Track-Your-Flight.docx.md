ext time you're flying to visit your Apple-using family or friends,
send them your flight number using Messages when you leave. Then they
can easily track your flight in the air and see when you're arriving.
Just text them the flight number prefixed with the airline's
abbreviation, like AA for American Airlines, AC for Air Canada, BA for
British Air, DL for Delta, or UA for United Airlines. If Messages
recognizes the flight number, it will underline it to indicate that
tapping or clicking will bring up the current flight information. This
feature also helps you extract more information from a texted flight
status update that an airline sends to you. If you know a flight number
but don't have it in Messages, you can get the same information on the
Mac using Spotlight (press Command-Space). On an iPhone or iPad, use the
Search feature (pull down on the Home screen).

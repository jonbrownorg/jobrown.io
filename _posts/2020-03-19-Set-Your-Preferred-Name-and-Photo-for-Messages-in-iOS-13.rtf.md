In your list of conversations in Messages, you probably have lots of
people who have generic icons next to their names or numbers. You likely
look like that to other people as well, but a new feature in iOS 13 lets
you share your preferred name and avatar picture with other iMessage
users (blue-bubble friends). In Messages, first tap the ••• button and
then Edit Name and Photo. Then, in the activity view that appears, tap
Edit under your photo to select a new photo and set your name as you
want it. Make sure Name and Photo Sharing is enabled before tapping
Done. From now on, for any iMessage conversations, you'll see a little
banner at the top that asks if you want to share your name and photo. Do
so and your recipient will get a prompt to replace whatever they're
seeing for you. (And if, as a recipient, you don't want to accept the
new photo, tap the X button at the right of the prompt.)

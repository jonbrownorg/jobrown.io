Although iOS and iPadOS are extremely stable, there are times when
rebooting your iPhone or iPad can eliminate odd or problematic behavior,
and there's no harm in trying it. In the past, you've had to [remember
which buttons to press](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201559) or
select Settings > General > Shut Down and then press a button to turn
the device back on. In iOS 16 and iPadOS 16, however, Siri has learned a
new trick: how to reboot iPhones and iPads. Invoke Siri by holding the
side button or Home button, and then say, "Reboot" or "Restart this
device." (Using "Hey Siri" can result in unexpected results, and saying
"Restart" on its own tends to cause Music to start playing the last
song.) Tap Restart, and your device reboots. If only this worked for the
Apple Watch and HomePod too!

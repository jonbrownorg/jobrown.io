Many years ago I worked at a graphic design firm and digital marketing company as their IT director. At that company they had a second floor that was mostly unused and they sublet the space out to some small startups, part of my job wasâ€™t to just support the needs of the company and its staff but to support these small startups as well. Make sure they had internet and access to audio visual technologies in conference rooms that sort of thing.

I built relationships with many of those startups. I eventually left that job and flash forward 2 years I was working a full time job at a non profit organization and that was when my side hustle of starting my own startup was just materializing. I heard that one of the startups I was supporting years earlier had their location a few blocks away from where I was working so I decided to walk over and stop by for a casual conversation and catch up visit. 

I got there and met with the individual I had worked with in the past job and we started talking about my business and the idea I had and where I wanted to take it, they were so excited and immediately offered their support, and even going so far as to offer space in their office where I could work out of while I got started, for free. 

That really blew me away and it really taught me that no matter where you are in life its not about the business, the idea or even your passions the only thing that matters are the relationships you build along the way.

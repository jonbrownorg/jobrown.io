## Use Copy as Pathname to Help Someone Find a File on the Mac
---

Have you ever needed to write directions for where to find a file on the
Mac? That's easy if it's in a well-traveled location, like the Music or
Pictures folder, but more difficult if it's in an obscure hidey-hole.
Rather than write out instructions like "Look in the Chrome folder
inside Google's Application Support folder in your user Library folder,"
select the item in question, hold down the Option key, and choose Edit
\> Copy "*ItemName*" as Pathname. (A *pathname,* or *path,* is the
sequence of nested folders that holds a file or folder, such as
/Users/adrian/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome.) Then paste the
path into an email message or word processing document (or wherever you
like). You'll now have the entire thing exactly where you need it, and
you don't have to worry that you've accidentally left out a navigational
step.

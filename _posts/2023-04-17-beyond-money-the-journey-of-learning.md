I didn't realize the monster I had created. Every time I would go outta town, I'd still be fielding phone calls, doing remote support by phone. There was no real plan in place for handing the reins to somebody for a while. So that was my big motive to grow my team. How did you handle that?

Did you grow your team over those years and where do you stand? I learned a lot about myself. I learned that I'm a little bit of a control freak and it was really hard for me to let go and start relying on other people. I built my company on the help of people that I had interacted with as a Mac technician.

So friends of people that I had met at conferences or fellow coworkers from previous jobs who had lean schedules and they were willing to help me out as a 1099 contractor here or there. But up until about two years ago, I really didn't have any full-time help to rely on, and so I.  Get where you're coming from.

Yeah I didn't really realize what I was doing by starting to go out there and saying, Hey make a monthly commitment, sign contracts, these are all sort of new things to me as a business owner. You look at the money and you're like, oh, wow, this is great. I'm getting reliable monthly income. And then it's like, all right, now, so exactly what you were saying, what have I done to myself, I've came, what have I done Talking to a corner, right? Yeah, exactly. So we're hiring people. It's still hard to find talent who they wanna work for a consulting company, it's a little bit different here because there are so many job opportunities for full-time  position with health insurance and benefits and all that sort of thing.

So we're learning and we're hiring people. But I think the most important thing is we're giving opportunities to people who might not have the opportunity to get into full-time position. We're training them and we're introducing them to the Mac and Apple community, and that's the part that I really like and enjoy doing.

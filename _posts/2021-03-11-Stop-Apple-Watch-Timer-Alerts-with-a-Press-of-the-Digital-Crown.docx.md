For those who cook, the Apple Watch provides a helpful Timer app that
ensures we don't forget whatever's in the oven until it's burnt to a
crisp. Setting the timer is easy from the app's interface, but even
easier is using Siri: just hold the Digital Crown and say, "Set a timer
for 8 minutes." When the timer goes off, the watch makes a sound or
vibrates and presents you with Stop and Repeat buttons. But often, when
a timer goes off, you're wearing oven mitts or moving quickly, making it
hard to look at the watch and tap the Stop button. There's a no-look
alternative you may not have known about---just press the Digital Crown
once (if the display is active) or twice (if the display is dimmed) to
stop the timer.

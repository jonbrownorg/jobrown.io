We all get too much email, and while Mail can't help you get less (other
than by making it easy to unsubscribe from mailing lists), it does
provide shortcuts for processing your mail more quickly. Regardless of
whether you're using iOS, iPadOS, or macOS, you can swipe on messages in
the message list to perform various actions---some of which you can
customize. It's an efficient way to work through email quickly.​

### Swiping on the iPhone and iPad

In iOS and iPadOS, when you swipe a short distance right on an unread
message (from left to right), Mail displays a Read button. You can
either stop swiping and tap it or keep swiping to the right to mark the
message as read. If the message has already been read, that button
changes to Unread. This swipe is great for those who like marking
messages as unread to keep them around for later processing.

Swipe left (from right to left) a short distance, and you get three
buttons, More, Flag, and Archive. (If you see Trash instead of Archive,
that's fine. We talk more about configuring which buttons you see
shortly.) Tap Archive to store the message in an Archive mailbox (or All
Mail for Gmail users), which is good for getting it out of your face
without deleting it. Flag marks the message with a flag so you can find
it again easily in Mail's Flagged mailbox---some people do this to track
messages that need replies or other actions. You can also swipe all the
way to the left to archive the message with one motion.

If you tap More, you get a bunch of additional options (depending on the
message) that include Reply, Reply All, Forward, Archive, Flag, Mark as
Read, Move Message (for filing in another folder), Trash Message, Move
to Junk, Mute (to silence notifications from the thread), and Notify Me
(which alerts you when anyone replies to the message).

Do you prefer to have your full swipes manage mail in a different way
than the default? Go to Settings > Mail > Swipe Options and choose
which button appears when you swipe right or left. You can select only
one unique action for the middle swipe left button and for the swipe
right action.

If you prefer to delete messages instead of archiving them, select
Archive in the Swipe Right settings and it will become Trash
automatically if the account requires swiping left to offer the Archive
button. If you use Gmail or some other email providers, you can reverse
these settings (so swiping left offers Trash and swiping right gives you
Archive) by navigating to Settings > Mail > Accounts > *YourAccount*
> Account > Advanced and selecting Deleted Mailbox under Move
Discarded Messages Into.

Remember that you can undo an errant swipe action by swiping left
anywhere on the screen with three fingers or by shaking the iPhone or
iPad, assuming you've left that setting enabled in Settings >
Accessibility > Touch.​

### Swiping on the Mac

On the Mac, swiping works similarly, but fewer options are available.
You can swipe right with two fingers to mark a message as read or
unread, depending on its current status, or you can swipe left to delete
or archive the message. Short swipes reveal a button you can click; long
swipes perform the action without needing an additional click.

As with Mail in iOS, you can toggle the delete/archive setting by
choosing Mail > Preferences > Viewing. Choose Trash or Archive from
the Move Discarded Messages Into pop-up menu.

That's it! Take a few minutes to practice swiping, and before long,
you'll be marking, flagging, and archiving messages with just a flick of
the finger.

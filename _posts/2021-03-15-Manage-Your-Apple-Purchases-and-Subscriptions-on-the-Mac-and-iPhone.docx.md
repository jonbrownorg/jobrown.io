Last quarter, Apple's Services segment generated a whopping $15.8
billion in revenue, 14% of the company's total---sales of apps, media,
and subscriptions are a big deal to Apple. And if you're like us, you're
probably now paying Apple for services like [Apple
Music](https://www.apple.com/apple-music/), [extra storage for iCloud
Photos](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201318), various app purchases
and subscriptions, and perhaps the new [Apple
Fitness+](https://www.apple.com/apple-fitness-plus/).

It's a lot to keep track of, but particularly with subscriptions, it's
essential to stay on top of the charges and make sure you're paying only
for services you're still using. Happily, Apple enables you to do that
on both the Mac and the iPhone/iPad.​

### Review Your Purchase History

On a Mac running macOS 11 Big Sur or 10.15 Catalina, you can see your
purchase history in the Music app. If you're running an earlier version
of macOS, you'll use iTunes instead. In either app, choose Account >
View My Account. Scroll down to Purchase History and click See All at
the right.

In Purchase History, you'll see every one of your purchases from Apple,
whether it's an app from the App Store, a book from Apple Books, or a
subscription like Apple TV+ (even when it's free). You can click the
More link to the right of any purchase for a few additional details (in
the screenshot below, these are showing for iCloud) or click the blue
Order ID link for even more details. Also hidden inside the Order ID
information for any item you paid for is a Resend link that sends you
another email copy of the invoice for that purchase.

On an iPhone or iPad, navigate to Settings > *Your Name* > Media &
Purchases > View Account > Purchase History (you'll need to scroll
down for the last one). The Purchase History screen shows the same
information as on the Mac, and you can tap the Total Billed line under
each item for the equivalent of the Order ID details, complete with a
button for resending the email invoice.

Apart from merely displaying your purchases, the Purchase History screen
can raise two other questions:

-   **Why isn't an item I purchased showing up?** The main reason why
    this happens is if the purchase was made with a different Apple ID.
    If you have two or more Apple IDs, that could explain it, or if
    you're participating in Family Sharing, a family member might have
    made the purchase. In either case, you must sign in with the
    appropriate Apple ID to see the purchase.

-   **What are these purchases that I don't recognize?** The most likely
    explanation is that someone in your Family Sharing group made a
    purchase without telling you. You can [turn on Ask to
    Buy](https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201089) if you have children in
    your family. If you've shared your Apple ID and password with
    someone else (never do that!) who has bought items without your
    knowledge, we recommend changing your Apple ID password immediately.
    If you still can't figure it out, [contact Apple
    Support](https://support.apple.com/contact).​

### Manage Subscriptions

For the most part, app, book, and other purchases aren't that expensive,
but subscription fees can add up quickly. We recommend checking your
subscriptions periodically to make sure they're all still relevant and
canceling any that aren't. Here's how.

On the Mac, you can manage your subscriptions in the Music app in Big
Sur or Catalina, though Apple recommends the App Store app. In the App
Store app, click your name or picture in the lower-left corner and then
click View Information at the upper right. In the window that appears,
scroll down to Manage and click the Manage link to the right of
Subscriptions.

Next, you're shown a list of all your active and expired subscriptions.

To see more details about a subscription, click Edit to the right of the
subscription's listing. You can now change your billing period using the
radio buttons and cancel the subscription by clicking Cancel
Subscription.

On an iPhone or iPad, it's a little more straightforward. Tap Settings
> *Your Name* > Subscriptions to see a list of all your subscriptions. Tap one of them to change the billing frequency or cancel it.

Although it's easier to manage subscriptions on a Mac, iPhone, or iPad,
you can also cancel subscriptions from the Apple Watch or Apple TV.
Here's what to do:

-   On the Apple Watch, open the App Store app, scroll to Account and
    tap it, tap Subscriptions, tap the desired subscription, and tap
    Cancel Subscription.

-   On the Apple TV, you can see subscriptions only for installed tvOS
    apps, and thus only for the Apple TV HD and Apple TV 4K. (For the
    third-generation Apple TV, use a Mac, iPhone, or iPad to manage
    subscriptions.) Open Settings, select Users & Accounts, select your
    account, select Subscriptions, choose the desired subscription, and
    select Cancel Subscription.

Finally, what if you don't see the subscription you want to cancel?
There are a few possibilities:

-   You can't cancel iCloud storage plans or AppleCare plans in this
    way. Apple provides separate instructions for [downgrading or
    canceling iCloud storage
    plans](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207594) and for [canceling
    AppleCare plans](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202704).

-   If a family member signed up for the subscription, you can't cancel
    it. Ask them to do so using their device.

-   Not all app subscriptions are billed through Apple. You'll need to
    [cancel outside subscriptions through the original
    vendor](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207865).

-   As with missing purchases, if you signed up for the subscription
    using a different Apple ID, you'll need to switch to that Apple ID
    to cancel.

We hope this article has shed some light on purchases and subscriptions
you make through various Apple online stores.

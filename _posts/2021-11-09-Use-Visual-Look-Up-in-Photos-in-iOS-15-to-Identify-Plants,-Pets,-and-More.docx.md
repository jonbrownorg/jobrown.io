## Use Visual Look Up in Photos in iOS 15 to Identify Plants, Pets, and More

Have you ever wanted to identify a plant, flower, or pet breed, or find
out what that famous painting is called? Us too. In iOS 15 and iPadOS
15, Apple added a new AI-driven feature called Visual Look Up that
provides more information about photos of plants, flowers, pets, books,
artworks, and landmarks. When you're viewing a photo, swipe up or tap
the sparkle-badged info button ➊ to see metadata about the image (camera
model, image details, location, and more) and then tap Look Up to learn
more ➋. Depending on the item recognized, it will suggest Wikipedia
articles, similar images from the Web, websites, bookstores, map
locations, and more. Tap a suggestion to switch to Safari or another app
for details. (If the info button doesn't have the sparkle badge, Visual
Look Up hasn't identified anything in the photo.)

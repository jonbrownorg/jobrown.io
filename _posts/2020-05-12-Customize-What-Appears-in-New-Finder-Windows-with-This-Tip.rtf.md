When you're in the Finder, choosing File \> New Finder Window does, as
you'd expect, open a new Finder window. But what folder appears in that
window? By default, new Finder windows open to Recents, which is a
built-in smart folder showing recently opened documents. If you'd prefer
to see items in a fixed location on your drive, go to Finder \>
Preferences \> General and choose any location from the New Finder
Windows Show pop-up menu. We're partial to Desktop or Documents, but you
can choose whatever folder makes sense with your workflow.

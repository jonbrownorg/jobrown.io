# Black Friday offers some of the best Apple deals of the year both at Apple and select retailers.

Today is Black Friday and that means big sales and discounts at retailers all over the country and online. Many brick and mortar stores reopened last night, offering significant discounts to waiting throngs of people ready to buy. Apple too is offering special deals on Black Friday with a [**one-day Black Friday sale**](ttps://www.apple.com/shop/gifts/one-day-shopping-event). Retailers selling Apple products are offing discounts throughout the four-day holiday weekend.

Apple&#39;s direct sale does not discount existing products but instead offers gift cards up to $150 with the purchase of certain products. $150 gift cards are available for the purchase of any Mac computer (MacBook, MacBook Air, MacBook Pro and iMac). $100 gift cards are included with the purchase of new iPads. $50 gift certificates are offered with the purchase of new iPhones and $25 gift certificates are offered with new Apple Watch purchases.

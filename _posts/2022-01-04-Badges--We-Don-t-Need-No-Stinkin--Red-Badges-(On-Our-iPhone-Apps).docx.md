Quick quiz: what does a red number badge on the Phone icon on your
iPhone mean? You'd be right if you said that it indicates the number of
missed calls or voicemail messages. The Mail and Messages apps also use
a red badge to display the number of unread messages; Settings uses one
to indicate that software updates are available; and Reminders shows a
badge for the number of tasks due today. Third-party apps also use red
badges to indicate that some number of somethings await you inside.
You'll also see a red badge on any folder that contains apps that are
themselves showing badges---the folder's badge sums the total of the
badges inside.

We're willing to bet that some of you stay on top of your badges at all
times, checking the missed calls, reading the messages, and completing
the to-dos. Others don't find the badges helpful and either ignore them
or find them somewhat annoying. Who needs to know they have 315 unread
email messages?

Here then is our advice on how to ensure that the red badges either
provide useful information or get out of your way.​

### Clear Badges Organically

Being told that you have 17 voicemail messages that you haven't listened
to or 32 unread texts in Messages isn't helpful---at best, you have to
remember that you had only 16 voicemail messages yesterday. There's no
option for dealing with them all at once, but it's worth taking a few
minutes while standing in line or otherwise killing time to clear the
badges manually.

Precisely how you do this depends on the app. In the Phone app, all you
have to do to clear the missed calls in the badge is tap Recents at the
bottom---that's enough to mark them as viewed. For voicemails, however,
you'll either have to listen to at least some of the message or delete
it by swiping all the way to the left. (Remember that you can drag the
playback slider to fast-forward if you want to mark it as listened
without actually doing so.)

In Messages and Mail, the trick is to read or delete each message. That
mostly means just loading it quickly and then moving on, although you
can also swipe left to delete unread conversations or email threads. In
Messages, you'll have to scroll through all your conversations, looking
for those that have a blue unread dot next to them. In Mail, you can tap
the Filter button at the bottom to show only unread messages (tap
Filtered By and select Unread if it's set some other way).

Regardless, the goal is to mark everything as dealt with so the badge
goes away, not for the sake of making it go away, but so when it returns
with the next unread message or new voicemail, it's giving you
actionable information.​

### Disable Unnecessary Badges

However, some badge numbers are never useful. Unless you receive very
little email, being told you have more than a handful of unread emails
will likely just cause stress, not encourage you to deal with those
messages. That's especially true if a session in Mail merely knocks the
number down to a still-high value. ("Oh good, now I only have 289 unread
messages.") Or you may just dislike the badges in general---that's fine
too.

Luckily, you can turn the badges off entirely. Go to Settings >
Notifications > *AppName* and disable Badges. You'll never see that red
badge of nagging again.

### Clear Stuck Badges

Sometimes an app will end up with a red badge even when you're certain
that you've done whatever is necessary to clear it. Here are a few
things to try:

-   **Update the app:** Go to the App Store app, tap your avatar in the
    upper-right corner, and tap Update All if it appears (pull down to
    make the App Store check for new updates). It's generally worth
    going to Settings > App Store and enabling App Updates so they come
    in automatically.


-   **Force-quit the app:** There's no reason to force-quit apps unless
    they're misbehaving, but a stuck badge counts as bad behavior. Swipe
    up from the very bottom of the screen and pause to enter the app
    switcher---or on Touch ID-equipped devices, double-press the Home
    button---and then swipe up on the card for the app in question to
    force-quit it.


-   **Restart the iPhone:** If all else fails, restart the iPhone.
    First, press and hold the side button and either volume button
    (iPhone X, 11, 12, and 13), the side button (iPhone 6, 7, 8, and
    second-generation iPhone SE ), or the top button (first-generation
    iPhone SE, iPhone 5, and earlier). Wait until the power off slider
    appears, drag it, wait 30 seconds, and then press either the side
    button or the top button to turn the iPhone back on.


-   **Disable that app's badges:** If nothing else works to clear a
    stuck badge, you can always resort to the steps above to disable
    badges for that app.

Making sure that app badges are either useful or hidden won't change
your life, but given how often we look at our iPhones, even little
tweaks like this can lift your mood.

Since the earliest days of the iPhone, Apple's Safari and Mail have been
the default Web and email apps for iOS and, later, iPadOS. There was no
way to choose alternatives that would be used whenever an app wanted to
open a Web page or create an email message. That has now changed with
iOS 14 and iPadOS 14. To switch to a different Web browser (such as
[Brave](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/brave-private-web-browser-vpn/id1052879175),
[DuckDuckGo Privacy
Browser](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/duckduckgo-privacy-browser/id663592361),
[Firefox](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/firefox-private-safe-browser/id989804926),
[Google
Chrome](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-chrome/id535886823),
[Microsoft
Edge](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-edge/id1288723196), or
[Opera
Touch](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/opera-touch-web-browser/id1411869974))
or a different email app (such as
[Boomerang](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/email-client-boomerang-mail/id1236906322),
[Chuck](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chuck-smarter-email/id1163872233),
[Hey](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hey-email/id1506603805),
[Gmail](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gmail-email-by-google/id422689480),
[Outlook](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-outlook/id951937596),
[Polymail](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/email-polymail/id1082058386),
or
[Spark](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spark-mail-email-by-readdle/id997102246)),
follow these directions. In Settings, tap the name of the browser or
email app you want to set as the default. Then tap Default Browser App
or Default Mail App and select the desired app.

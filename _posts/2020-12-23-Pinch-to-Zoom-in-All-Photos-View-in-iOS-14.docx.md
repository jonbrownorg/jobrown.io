Photos in iOS 14 provides four views of your library: Years, Months,
Days, and All Photos. For the first three, Photos picks representative
images that may not include particular shots you're looking for. The All
Photos view shows everything, but it can be overwhelming. What's not
apparent is that you can navigate All Photos more easily by pinching in
to shrink the thumbnails and then pinching out to make them larger
again. At the largest size, a single photo takes up the entire width of
the screen.

It's taken as gospel that Macs are more expensive than PCs. A quick look
at the Dell Web site reveals laptops for as low as $300. Sure, we can
say that the configurations aren't comparable, that macOS is better than
Windows, or that Apple's hardware quality is superior. Still, our
friendly local bean counters have trouble getting past those low upfront
prices.

However, unless you're Rancho Gordo, the goal isn't to count beans, it's
to get work done, and that's a different scenario. Let's look at a few
ways that Macs are not just worth the money but can also be cheaper than
comparable systems. We'll start with [a Forrester Research
study](https://tools.totaleconomicimpact.com/go/Apple/TEI/){:rel="nofollow"}
commissioned by Apple that compared the total economic impact of Macs
and PCs in large companies with employee-choice programs. In such
programs, every employee gets to choose between a Mac and a PC,
providing a sizable group across which to compare numbers, but the
conclusions apply to large and small organizations alike.​

**Deeper Cost Analysis**

Although the Forrester Research study found that the upfront acquisition
cost of Macs was indeed \$500 higher than comparable PCs, when
additional factors were taken into account, Macs ended up costing about
$50 less.

That's in part because Macs have a higher residual value after 3 years,
meaning that you can resell a 3-year-old Mac for more than a 3-year-old
PC. Pay more up front, but get more back later on.

Macs also don't need operating system licenses, and the Mac's better
security eliminates the need for additional licenses for security
software.​

**Reduced IT Support Costs**

It has long been thought that Macs required less support than PCs, but
only in the past few years have there been organizations with enough
Macs and PCs to compare. At IBM, one of the largest Apple-using
companies with 290,000 Apple devices, [a 2016
study](https://www.jamf.com/blog/debate-over-ibm-confirms-that-macs-are-535-less-expensive-than-pcs/){:rel="nofollow"}
found that the company was saving up to \$543 per Mac compared to PCs
over a 4-year lifespan. Forrester Research came up with an even higher
number, showing that Macs cost $628 less over a 3-year lifespan.

What accounts for these reduced support costs? It takes less time to set
up a new Mac, Macs are easier to manage, Macs users open fewer service
tickets, and many fewer IT staff are needed. All that adds up to paying
for fewer support resources. In [another 2018
study](https://www.jamf.com/resources/press-releases/ibm-announces-research-showing-mac-enables-greater-productivity-and-employee-satisfaction-at-ibm/){:rel="nofollow"},
IBM found that it needed just 7 support engineers per 200,000 Macs,
compared to 20 support engineers per 200,000 Windows machines.​

**Improved Employee Productivity and Engagement**

Beyond reduced support costs, Mac users turn out to be more productive,
more engaged, and more likely to stay with the company than PC users.
Forrester Research found that over 3 years, Mac-using employees posted
48 hours more productivity (in part due to reduced downtime). That's
likely thousands of dollars more benefit to the company, per employee.

Even still, it can be hard to quantify that benefit, which is why
Forrester Research compared users in sales positions. In its study,
Forrester found that Mac-using employees showed a 5% increase in sales
performance. That's nothing compared to IBM, which found that its
Mac-based salespeople closed deals worth 16% more than their
Windows-using counterparts.

Finally, both Forrester Research and IBM discovered that Mac users were
less likely to leave the company---20% less likely in Forrester's study
and 17% less likely in IBM's research. That's not just an indication of
loyalty. There are significant costs to replacing employees who leave,
so the higher the retention rate, the better it is for the bottom line.​

**Improved Overall Security**

Few would argue with the belief that Macs are more secure than PCs. In
Forrester's research, the interviewed organizations said that the Mac
has a fundamentally more secure architecture than Windows. In today's
world, criminals employ malware to steal information. Data breaches are
costly, with [a 2019 study by IBM Security and the Ponemon
Institute](https://www.ibm.com/security/data-breach){:rel="nofollow"} pegging the
average cost of a data breach at \$3.9 million. The amounts vary by
industry and the size of the breach, of course, but the average cost per
data record was nearly \$150.

Security breaches can have other costs as well. With a compromised
account, attackers have often been able to pose as executives and get
accounting departments to wire money to offshore accounts. Plus, when
news of a data breach hits, it can result in the loss of customers. In
the IBM Security study, healthcare companies suffered from a 7% customer
turnover after a breach.

So yes, Macs do have higher upfront costs than PCs. But savvy managers
know to look past such simplistic comparisons to the bigger picture,
where equipping employees with Macs both saves far more than the
difference in cost between a Mac and a PC and enables employees to
produce more for the organization.

Until watchOS 9, Low Power Mode on the Apple Watch turned the smartwatch
into a dumb watch that only told the time. With watchOS 9 on an Apple
Watch Series 4 or later, however, a new Low Power Mode reduces the
watch's capabilities while keeping it largely functional. It turns off
the Always-On display, heart rate notifications, background heart rate
and blood oxygen measurements, and the automatic start workout reminder.
When your iPhone isn't nearby, it disables Wi-Fi and cellular
connections and incoming phone calls and notifications. Other features
will be slower: making a phone call, refreshing background apps and
complications, Siri requests, and some interface interactions. (You can
still use the Workout app in Low Power Mode and record metrics like
heart rate and pace. Go to Settings \> Workout on the Apple Watch to
turn Low Power Mode on automatically whenever you start a workout.)
watchOS 9 prompts you to turn on Low Power Mode when your battery drops
to 10%, or you can enable it manually by swiping up from the bottom of
the screen to open Control Center, tapping the battery percentage
button, and enabling the
option.

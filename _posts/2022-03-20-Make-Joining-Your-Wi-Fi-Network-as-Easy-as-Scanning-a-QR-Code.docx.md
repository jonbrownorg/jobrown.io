Whether you have guests who want to get on your home Wi-Fi network,
customers who need to join your business network, or attendees who want
to use your conference network, it's always fussy to share the network
name and password. If an iPhone user has your Apple ID email address in
Contacts, their device should [automatically prompt you to share your
Wi-Fi password](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209368), but that
won't work in many situations.

Here's another option: a QR (Quick Response, if you're curious) code
that, once scanned, lets the person join your network without knowing
its name or password. Once you've created this QR code, you can print it
on a card to share, post it on a bulletin board, or make a custom sign.
QR codes are no longer the curiosity they once were, with usage
skyrocketing since the pandemic. One estimate suggests that over 83
million US adult smartphone users will scan a QR code in 2022.

Follow these steps to create your custom Wi-Fi network QR code:

1.  Visit [QRCode Monkey](https://www.qrcode-monkey.com/#wifi) and click
    the WIFI tab at the top. (Other sites, like [QR Code
    Generator](https://www.qr-code-generator.com/) and
    [Flowcode](https://www.flowcode.com/), will also work but may
    require a paid account.)

2.  Enter the name of your network---also known as the SSID---in the
    Wireless SSID field.

3.  If your network has a password, enter it in the Password field,
    click Encryption, and choose WPA/WPA2. (If your network still relies
    on the old and completely insecure WEP, choose that instead---and
    plan to upgrade to a new base station with WPA support soon!)

4.  If you're sharing access to a guest network that has no password,
    leave the password field blank and Encryption set to No Encryption.

5.  To change your QR code's foreground and background colors from
    black and white, click Set Colors, click a color square, and click
    on the desired color in the color picker. (You can also enter color
    hex values.) If you plan to upload a logo, make sure the color works
    well with your logo.

6.  If you have a logo that you want to include, click Add Logo Image
    and upload your logo. You may want to resize the white space around
    the logo to position the logo nicely in the middle of the QR code.
    If the logo's background doesn't match your background color, you
    may wish to select Remove Background Behind Logo.

7.  For a snazzier look, click Customize Design and choose among the
    various options for Body Shape (the overall pattern), Eye Frame
    Shape (the corner frames), and Eye Ball Shape (the shape inside the
    corner frames).

8.  Click the Create QR Code button on the right to preview your custom
    design. Repeat Steps 5 through 8 until the QR code looks the way you
    want.

9.  Adjust the Quality slider if desired---the default of 1000-by-1000
    pixels is generally fine.

10. Click the Download PNG button to get the actual file. You can also
    click the SVG, PDF, or EPS buttons to download those less common
    formats.

That's it! Once you've downloaded the QR code image file to your Mac,
you can print itÂ on its own, add it to other print designs, or even put
it on your website. There's probably a size that is too small for
cameras to resolve accurately, but that's easy to test using your iPhone
or iPad.

From then on, anyone can access your Wi-Fi network by pointing the
camera app on their phone at your QR code---they'll be grateful for the
easy access, and you'll no longer have to supply them with the network
information. It's a win-win!

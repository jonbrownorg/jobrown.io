Prior to iOS 13, when you were editing text on an iPhone or iPad, Apple
provided a magnifying glass that showed the position of the insertion
point. It worked, but was clumsier than just moving the insertion point
directly, which is what Apple enabled in iOS 13 and iOS 14. The only
problem? Your finger usually obscures the text you want to edit. In iOS
15, Apple brought back the text magnification bubble to show you where
the insertion point is in the text under your finger. If you've missed
that feature, touch and hold on some text and drag the insertion point.
Even easier is trackpad mode on the iPhone, which lets you touch and
hold the Space bar to turn the entire keyboard area into a virtual
trackpad that lets you move the insertion point above.

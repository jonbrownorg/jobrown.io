On Monday the 8th of January 2018 Apple released macOS High Sierra 10.13.2 Supplemental Update.

You may have heard about “Spectre” & “Meltdown" in the news in the last week of 2017 these are hardware-based exploits that exploit the way CPU’s process data, this could allow a hacker to gain access to your sensitive data. 

Meltdown was addressed in the macOS High Sierra 10.13.2 update in December 2017, for Spectre there is no hardware fix, instead Apple is addressing the vulnerability using Safari.

When you update to macOS High Sierra 10.13.2 Supplemental Update this will also update Safari to version 11.0.2 (13604.4.7.1.6) or version 11.0.2 (13604.4.7.10.6), again these are supplemental updates so you have to check the version number:

- Open Safari.
- Choose Safari > About Safari.

We can see above Safari has not been updated although the version number 11.0.2 could make us think it has.

Apple has also released an update for Safari running on macOS Sierra and OS X El Capitan:

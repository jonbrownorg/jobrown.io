Do you need to be careful about how much data you use with your iPhone
or iPad, either via cellular or Wi-Fi? That could be true for those with
Internet data caps, people using an international plan while traveling,
and anyone in an area with slow data speeds. To reduce your data usage,
turn on Low Data Mode, which you can do separately for cellular and
Wi-Fi. For cellular, look in Settings > Cellular > Cellular Data
Options, where you can either enable Low Data Mode for LTE/4G or take
one more step into Data Mode for 5G. If you're using two plans with a
dual SIM iPhone, you can set each one separately. For Wi-Fi, go to
Settings > Wi-Fi and tap the i button next to the desired Wi-Fi network
and then tap Low Data Mode. Apple lists [what you can expect to
change](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210596) in Low Data Mode. If
you need a similar capability for the Mac, check out
[TripMode](https://tripmode.ch/).

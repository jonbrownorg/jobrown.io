Adobe says that [Pantone Color Books will be phased out of Adobe
Creative Cloud
apps](https://community.adobe.com/t5/illustrator-discussions/changes-to-pantone-color-books/td-p/13076187),
starting with updates to Illustrator, InDesign, and Photoshop released
after August 16, 2022. After November 2022, only three Pantone Color
Books will remain: Pantone + CMYK Coated, Pantone + CMYK Uncoated, and
Pantone + Metallics Coated. To access all other Pantone Color Libraries,
Creative Cloud users will need to purchase a [Pantone Connect
license](https://www.pantone.com/connect) and access the libraries
through the [Pantone Connect
plug-in](https://exchange.adobe.com/creativecloud.details.103029.pantone-connect.html).
Pantone Connect costs \$59.99 per year or \$7.99 per month. For the most
part, existing files should continue to work as before, although Adobe
offers details of how files in
[Illustrator](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/kb/pantone-color-books-illustrator.html),
[InDesign](https://helpx.adobe.com/indesign/kb/pantone-color-books-indesign.html),
and
[Photoshop](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/kb/pantone-color-books-photoshop.html)
may be affected.

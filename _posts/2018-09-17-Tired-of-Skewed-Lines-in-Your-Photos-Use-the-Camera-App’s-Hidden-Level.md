## Tired of Skewed Lines in Your Photos? Use the Camera App's Hidden Level.
---

If you've ever photographed a sheet of paper or some other rectangular
object, the image may have come out skewed because you inadvertently
tilted the camera. The iOS 11 Camera app has a level feature to help you
avoid this problem, but it's so subtle that you may not have noticed it.
To use it, first go to Settings \> Camera and turn on the Grid switch so
thin white lines divide the viewfinder image into a grid of nine
rectangles. Then, to access the level, hold the iPhone or iPad flat, so
the camera points straight down toward the floor (or straight up toward
the sky, if you're photographing a ceiling). Notice that two crosshairs
appear in the middle of the viewfinder, a yellow one that marks the
position where the camera will be level and a white one that shows the
camera's current angle. Tilt the camera until the crosshairs merge into
a single yellow image, and tap the Shutter button.

pple did a good job rethinking some aspects of credit card use with the
Apple Card, but one omission was the inability to share it with other
family members. With the new [Apple Card
Family](https://www.apple.com/apple-card/family/), once everyone has
upgraded to iOS 14.6, you can add members of your Family Sharing group
to your Apple Card account as either Co-Owners or Participants.
Co-Owners can merge their credit lines, manage the account together, and
build credit as equals. You can also invite children over 13 and young
adults as Participants. For their accounts, you can set spending limits
and receive real-time notifications. Participants over 18 can build
their own credit, something that can be difficult for young people. To
get started, go to the Wallet app on your iPhone, open the Apple Card,
tap the ••• button, tap Share My Card, follow any prompts, for the
person you want to share with, and select either Co-Owner or
Participant.

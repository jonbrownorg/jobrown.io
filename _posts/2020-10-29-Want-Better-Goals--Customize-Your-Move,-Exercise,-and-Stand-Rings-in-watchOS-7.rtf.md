Ever since Apple introduced the
Activity app to watchOS, you've been able to adjust your Move goal,
which is measured in kilocalories, but your Exercise goal was locked at
30 minutes and the Stand goal at 12 hours. In watchOS 7, you can finally
change these last two. In the Activity app on your Apple Watch, scroll
to the bottom and tap Change Goals. Then, for each screen, adjust the
goal numbers in whatever way will most motivate you. Some people like
setting the goals higher than they're likely to reach so they can more
easily see how well they've done as a percent of the whole, whereas
others might like to tweak them so the goals are just a little out of
reach.

If you have a friend whom you refer to only by his nickname, it can be
annoying to feel like you should use his proper first name when adding
him to Contacts. Worse, then he shows up in Messages with a name you
don't recognize as easily. Here's how to convince iOS to use his
nickname instead. Open his card in Contacts, tap Edit, scroll to the
bottom, tap Add Field, and tap Nickname. That puts a Nickname field at
the top, under his proper name, for you to fill in. To get iOS to use
it, go to Settings \> Contacts \> Short Name and enable Prefer
Nicknames. From then on, you can enter your friend's nickname instead of
his proper name in apps like Messages and Mail, and iOS will also
display it instead of his name everywhere.

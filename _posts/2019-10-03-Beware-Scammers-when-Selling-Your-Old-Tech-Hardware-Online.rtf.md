Whenever Apple releases hot new hardware, it's tempting to order the
latest and greatest and then put your old Mac or iPhone up for sale on a
classifieds site like Craigslist. If you do that, [be cautious about
potential
buyers](https://www.reddit.com/r/craigslist/comments/bkjw6f/this_is_probably_a_scammer_but/){:rel="nofollow"}---it's
increasingly common for a scammer to request that you ship them the
device and then to "pay" you by forging payment email from PayPal or
using a stolen PayPal account (whose owner will likely get PayPal to
take the money back from you). Instead, insist on an in-person meeting
in a public place and payment in cash or via a digital method like Apple
Pay Cash or Venmo that can't be canceled once you accept the money. Or,
if the location and payment amount (under \$1000) work, meet in a nearby
post office and request payment via money order
([US](https://www.usps.com/shop/money-orders.htm){:rel="nofollow"} or
[Canada](https://www.usps.com/shop/money-orders.htm){:rel="nofollow"}) that you
can verify on the spot. Craigslist has [more

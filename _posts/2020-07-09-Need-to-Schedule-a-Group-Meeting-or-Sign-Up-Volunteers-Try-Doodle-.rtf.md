Have you ever set up a group meeting, whether in person or via
videoconferencing, but found it cumbersome to find a time that works for
everyone? Or maybe you want to solicit volunteers for an event? There's
a neat online tool that makes such logistics easy:
[Doodle](https://doodle.com/). You can use it for free (with
ads)---even without setting up an account. Or, if you want to eliminate
the ads and get support for calendar syncing, deadlines, reminders,
multiple users, and more, there are paid [Premium
plans](https://doodle.com/premium). You can use Doodle in a Web
browser or download [the Doodle iOS
app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/doodle-easy-scheduling/id938182547).​

**Determine Your Poll Type**

Setting up a Doodle poll is easy. The first step is to figure out what
sort of poll you want---a time poll or a text poll. A time poll is best
if you want to let your respondents vote for specific dates and times.
Use it when you're trying to determine if the club Zoom call should be
Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday, and at 11 AM, 3 PM, or 5 PM on one of
those days.

In contrast, a text poll lets your respondents vote on anything. For
example, you could use a text poll to see where a large group would like
to have a party (your house, the park, a favorite restaurant), or what
sort of food people want for lunch (Thai, Mexican, Ethiopian). You could
even use a Doodle text poll to see who among a large group of volunteers
can help at a series of 5K races.​

**Set the Poll Options**

After you click the big red Create a Doodle button at the top of the
Doodle Web page, you work your way through a four-step wizard. The first
step merely asks for the title of your poll and an optional location and
note.

The second step is where all the magic happens. You have three choices
here: Month, Week, and Text. In Month view, you get a calendar from
which you can pick days and optionally add times. Month view is best for
picking the best day for a picnic, for instance, and the time would be
the same regardless of which day is chosen.

Week view is the most common way that people use Doodle, because it's
how you choose times for a meeting. Just drag a box out for each
proposed time period. If you make the box too big or small, you can
resize it from the bottom, and you can also drag boxes to different
times. To delete a box, hover over it and click the X that appears in
its upper-right corner. Note that if you're creating a poll for an event
you need to attend, it's not worth including dates or times when you
can't make it.

With a text poll, you can enter anything you want for the poll options.
In the screenshot, we're using Doodle as a volunteer signup sheet.

Once you click Continue, you move on to the Poll Settings screen, which
provides four useful settings:

-   **Yes, no, if need be:** Select this option if
    you want to allow your participants to have a "maybe" or "if it's
    absolutely necessary" or "you can twist my arm" option. We're fond
    of this option because many scheduling questions don't have a simple
    Yes/No answer.
-   **Limit the number of votes per option:** An
    example of where this option is helpful is if you want only so many
    people to bring a main course, salad, or dessert to a
    picnic---otherwise, the menu can get out of balance.
-   **Limit participants to a single vote:** Employ
    this option to prevent people from signing up for multiple options.
-   **Hidden poll:** By default, the results of
    Doodle polls are visible to everyone who has the link, which is
    usually good. Select this option to keep people from seeing each
    other's votes.

The final step just asks for your name and email address, after which
Doodle displays your poll so you can share it and vote in it. Before you
do anything else, click the Copy button in the Invite Participants box
and paste it somewhere for later reference. If you have a Doodle
account---free or paid---you can also have it send email, but we
recommend sending the email yourself instead so you have complete
control over the message.

Now it's your turn to vote. For each option, click once for Yes (a green
checkmark) or twice for Maybe (a yellow checkmark). Leave a box blank to
vote No. If you need to edit your votes afterward, you can do so (click
the blue pencil icon that appears next to your name) if you were logged
in to an account when you voted or if the Web page remembers you.

​

**Solicit Votes**

Remember that link you copied a minute ago? Now's the time to send it
out. The beauty of Doodle is that you can send it to as few or as many
people as you want, in any way you want. You could message it to a group
of friends, send it to the office email exploder, post it in your
company's Slack, publish it to a public mailing list, or even post it on
Facebook or Twitter. Other people can share it as well, if you're trying
to cast a wide net.

Doodle polls don't have any security beyond the obscurity of their URLs,
so if your poll is at all confidential,make
sure to tell people not to share it further. ​

**Pick a Winner**

If you've set up an account, you'll receive a notification whenever
anyone votes in your poll. You can also load the link you shared at any
time to see how the votes are progressing. In our Month poll, three
people have voted, and you can see that June 13th and June 27th are the
most popular work, so you get to choose.

In the Week poll, it's obvious that there's only one option that works
well for everyone, June 12th at 9 AM. However, you can see that June
12th at 2 PM is possible, in case something changes and you need a
backup time.

Finally, in our text poll looking for volunteers, there's no "winning."
The poll results merely tell you who can work at which races, and if you
only need three volunteers for each race, you're all set. However, you
can also see that you may need to line up another person in case Rashid
Cookie ends up bailing on you.

Although the results are usually perfectly obvious, you can click a red
Choose Final Option button if you're the poll creator and are logged in
or remembered. That identifies the best choice, although you can
override it with a click, and closes the poll so no one else can vote.
If you're logged in and have connected your calendar, you can add it
directly from the results page. We usually announce the final choice
however we shared the poll link, and anyone who wants to see the voting
results can load the poll again.

As you can imagine, Doodle's Premium plans add quite a few more
features, and they may be worthwhile if you end up using it regularly.
However, for quick scheduling of group meetings or lightweight polling,
you can stick with either the free account or use it without even
logging in. Give it a try next time you need to poll a group!

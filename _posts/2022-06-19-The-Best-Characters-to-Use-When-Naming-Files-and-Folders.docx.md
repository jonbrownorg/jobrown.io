ack in the early 1980s, DOS filenames couldn't be more than 8
characters long with a period and a 3-character extension. That was
limiting, so when Apple developed the Mac operating system in 1984, it
allowed longer names and eliminated the need for an extension, although
Mac OS X's Unix roots meant a return of the filename extension in 2001.
Since then, filename restrictions have loosened to the point where it's
easy to think that they no longer exist.

If only that were true! In some ways, the situation has become even
cloudier, thanks to additional limitations from file-sharing services
like
[Dropbox](https://help.dropbox.com/files-folders/sort-preview/file-names),
[OneDrive](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/restrictions-and-limitations-in-onedrive-and-sharepoint-64883a5d-228e-48f5-b3d2-eb39e07630fa#invalidcharacters),
and
[Box](https://support.box.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043696194-Box-Sync-Problem-Notification-Name-Not-Supported).
(Google Drive's native Web interface reportedly has no naming
limitations, but files whose names contain Windows or macOS forbidden
characters may not sync via Google Drive's desktop software.) Plus,
people tend to move files between operating systems more than ever
before---if you're sending a file from your Mac to a Windows user
through Dropbox, you need to make sure that all three can deal with the
filename.

At least length isn't something that you
generally have to think about these days, since both macOS and
Windows---and the cloud services---accept filenames up to 255 characters
in length. Technically speaking, Windows limits directory paths (the
enclosing folder names along with the filename) to 255 characters, but
even still, that shouldn't be difficult to avoid.

What could go wrong if you run afoul of a naming restriction? macOS and
Windows may simply not let you type the character---for example, you
can't put a colon in a Mac filename. Putting a period at the start of a
Mac or Unix filename will hide the file. Cloud sharing services might
rename the file, or you might encounter syncing issues where files don't
appear where they should. Certain characters can also cause trouble when
files are used at the command line.

Here are the characters to avoid and the operating systems and services
that prohibit them:

-   **: (colon):** macOS, Windows, Dropbox, OneDrive, Box

-   **. (period):** macOS (at the start of a name), Dropbox

-   **/ (forward slash):** macOS, Windows, Dropbox, OneDrive, Box

-   **\\ (backslash):** Windows, Dropbox, OneDrive, Box

-   **\< (less than):** Windows, Dropbox, OneDrive, Box

-   **\> (greater than):** Windows, Dropbox, OneDrive, Box

-   **\" (double quote):** Windows, Dropbox, OneDrive, Box

-   **\| (vertical bar or pipe):** Windows, Dropbox, OneDrive, Box

-   **? (question mark):** Windows, Dropbox, OneDrive, Box

-   **\* (asterisk):** Windows, Dropbox, OneDrive, Box

-   **\^ (caret):** Windows (using FAT-formatted drives)

In addition, avoid using special characters like the Â© (copyright)
symbol or emoji ðŸ¤· in filenames. They might work locally, but all bets
are off if you share the files in any way.

A few other recommendations:

-   Avoid unusual punctuation; in particular, note that [OneDrive
    renames
    filenames](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/why-has-my-filename-changed-f14307b4-e9ff-4cd9-be79-9524bb323744)
    containing:

    -   **, (comma)** to \^J

    -   **\# (number sign)** to \^N

    -   **& (ampersand)** to \^O

    -   **\~ (tilde)** to \^F

-   Never start or end file or folder names with a space, and avoid
    spaces in filenames that will be uploaded to a Web or SFTP server.

-   Avoid putting more than one period in a filename, and don't put a
    period *after* a filename extension.

-   Never assume that names are case sensitive---always make sure that
    similarly named items differ by more than just case.

If all that seems like a lot to keep in mind, here's the simple rule
that will ensure your filenames will work everywhere:

> *Name files only with uppercase (A-Z) and lowercase (a-z) letters,
> digits (0-9), and the hyphen (-) and underscore (\_), plus a single
> period (.) and extension.*

It's been an interesting year and a busy few months with plenty of
updates for the CMMC assessment requirements process.  For some
background, the CMMC (cybersecurity maturity model certification) was
created by the DOD and requires that its 300,000 supplier, primes, and
subs (i.e., the Defense Supply Chain (DSC)) become compliant with
defined cybersecurity practices and processes at various levels needed
for compliance.

In late September, the DOD published an interim rule amending
requirements for both DFARS and CMMC compliance.  As
described [here](https://www-natlawreview-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/www.natlawreview.com/article/dod-s-long-awaited-rule-cmmc-plus-new-cybersecurity-assessment-methodology?amp),
the interim rule will go into effect on November 30, 2020, so DSC
providers should be aware.

The DOD has overhauled the NIST SP 800-171 assessment methodology in
which contractors are already required to be compliant per DFARS
252.204-7012.  Going forward, the DOD will require the contractor to
self-certify and verify compliance before new contracts will be
awarded.  The assessment methodology has three levels for basic, medium,
or high in which the basic assessment can be completed prior to contract
award and medium/high after award completion.  DSC providers need to be
careful to ensure compliance and implementation requirements or the
company might be subject to a False Claims Act violation.  DSC providers
can get started with NIST recommendations for self-assessment of the
DFARS requirements
provided [here](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/hb/2017/NIST.HB.162.pdf). 

Another big result of the interim ruling going into effect is that the
DOD plans to fully commit and move forward with the CMMC as
re-affirmation to companies that part of the DSC begins the process of
getting certified immediately.  The DOD has provided a timeline starting
in 2021 and going forward with the number of new DOD contracts per year
having clauses that state the contractor must be compliant with the CMMC
requirements to that contract at award time.  The DSC contractor is [not
required]{.underline} to be compliant at the stated CMMC level when
bidding on the contract but must be at the required level by award
time.  The DOD will also require by FY 2026 all DOD contracts will have
a CMMC compliance requirements clause.  Once certified at the chosen
CMMC level, the DSC contractor will need to be re-certified every three
years or per significant change to the infrastructure or organization.

The CMMC-AB is actively working with the DOD on ensuring a proper
rollout of CMMC assessment procedures and requirements.  At this time,
it is highly encouraged for DSC contractors to begin getting their
company and IT environments ready for CMMC compliance.

getting your organization ready for the assessment with security
architecture and be compliant with the applicable practices and
processes for your needed CMMC Level?  See how Grove can help you

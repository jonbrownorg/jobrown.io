In iOS 14, Apple overhauled widgets, allowing you to add them to your
Home screen in addition to the Today View accessible by swiping right on
the Home screen. App developers responded with a slew of new widgets,
but old-style widgets that are limited to Today View remain available.
If you no longer want these older widgets cluttering the bottom of your
Today View, here's how to remove them. Swipe right on the Home screen to
enter Today View. At the bottom of Today View, tap the Edit button, and
at the bottom of the collection of old-style widgets (new-style widgets
wiggle), tap Customize. In the Add Widgets screen, tap the red **‚äñ**
button next to each widget you want to delete and confirm by tapping
Remove.

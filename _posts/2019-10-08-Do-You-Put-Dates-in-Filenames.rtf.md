There are plenty of situations where it makes sense to put a date in a
filename, but if you don't use the right date format, the files may sort
in unhelpful ways. For instance, using the names of months is a bad
idea, since they'll sort alphabetically, putting April before January.
And although the Mac's Finder is smart enough to sort filename-3 before
filename-20, most other operating systems are not (because 2 comes
before 3). So, to make your life---and the lives of everyone with whom
you share files---a little easier, use this date format, which is
guaranteed to sort correctly everywhere: YYYY-MM-DD. That translates to
a four-digit year, followed by a two-digit month (with a leading zero if
necessary), and a two-digit day (again, with a leading zero if need be).

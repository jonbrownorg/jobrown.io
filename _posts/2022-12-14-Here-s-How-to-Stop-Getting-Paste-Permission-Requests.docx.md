In iOS 16, Apple tightened security by displaying a confirmation alert
when you copy data from one app and paste it into another. More security
isn't bad, but these alerts can become annoying if you copy and paste
frequently. In iOS 16.1, Apple added a setting to control the behavior
for each app. If you get these alerts too often when pasting in an app,
go to Settings > *AppName* > Paste from Other Apps and switch it from
Ask to Allow. Many apps don't include the setting; hopefully, any apps
where you paste often will have this setting or include it soon.

Hey everybody! In today's video, I'm excited to introduce you to one of my favorite Apple binary applications - Hear. Hear is an incredible program that allows you to transcribe text using the dictation feature directly from Terminal or convert audio and movie files into text. It utilizes the built-in dictation feature of Mac OS, making transcription tasks easier than ever before.

### ðŸ”§ How to Use Hear:
Enable Dictation: Before you install Hear, ensure that dictation is enabled on your Mac. Check your system settings under keyboard preferences to turn on dictation.

### Installation Steps:
- Visit the GitHub repository (link below) and download the latest release (version 0.4 as of now). https://github.com/sveinbjornt/hear
- Follow the installation instructions in Terminal using the provided command. If you encounter a permission denied error, use 'sudo' before the command and enter your password to install successfully.

### Transcription Options:
- Live Transcription: Type 'hear' in Terminal to transcribe audio live from your microphone.
- File Transcription: Use the command 'hear --d --i' to transcribe audio or movie files directly in Terminal. Specify the input file and designate the output location.

### ðŸ’¡ Why Hear is Awesome:
Hear is a well-maintained program that ensures accurate transcription without compromising your data privacy. It's an invaluable tool for content creators, making it essential for creating quality videos and text content.

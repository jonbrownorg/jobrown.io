In previous versions of iOS, a scroll bar would appear on the right edge
of the screen while you were swiping through a long Web page, email
message, or document. But the scroller was merely an indicator of where
in the page you were and how much content there was (the bigger the
scroller, the less content). In iOS 13 and iPadOS 13, however, Apple has
made the scroll bar more helpful, and you'll want to use it to scroll
long pages more quickly than you can with swiping. To use the scroll
bar, swipe slightly to make it appear, press and hold the scroller, and
drag it to scroll. The only hard part is that it can be tricky to grab
since it disappears a few seconds after you stop scrolling, and it's a
thin target to hit with a thick finger. But give it a try since it makes
scrolling in long pages so much easier.

## Look Up All Sorts of Information with a Quick Click or Tap on the Mac
---

Apple makes it easy to look up information about any word you can see on
your Mac, in nearly any app. To access this information, Control- or
right-click the word and choose Look Up "*word*", use the trackpad to
tap the word with three fingers, or hover the pointer over it and press
Command-Control-D. macOS displays a popover with a dictionary
definition. And in 10.12 Sierra and later, you can also swipe right with
two fingers on the trackpad (or click the buttons at the bottom) to see
much more in the popover, including Wikipedia entries, apps, news,
sports info, movies, TV shows, music, maps, Twitter accounts, and more.
Give it a try a few times, and it might become a habit!

On the Mac, nearly every file has an *extension*, a set of characters
after a period that indicates what type of file it is and determines
which app opens it. So, **.png** indicates a PNG graphic that opens in
Preview by default, **.pages** denotes a Pages document, and **.docx**
identifies a file as belonging to and opening in Microsoft Word. Plus,
the extension for all applications is **.app**. Depending on what you
do, how often you exchange files with people on other platforms, and
your personal preference, you may wish to see more or fewer extensions.
You control that in Finder > Preferences > Advanced, with the "Show
all filename extensions" checkbox. Individual files can override the
setting, so if an extension isn't doing what you want, select the file,
choose File > Get Info, and check or uncheck the Hide Extension
checkbox in the Info window.

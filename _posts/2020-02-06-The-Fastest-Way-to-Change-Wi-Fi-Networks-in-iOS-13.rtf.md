Historically, picking a new Wi-Fi network has required you to open the
Settings app and tap Wi-Fi, forcing you to unlock your iPhone or switch
away from what you were doing. In iOS 13, however, Apple added a better
way to connect to a new Wi-Fi network. Open Control Center (swipe down
from the upper-right corner on an iPhone X or later or an iPad; or up
from the bottom on an earlier iPhone), press and hold on the network
settings card in the upper-left corner to expand it, and then press and
hold on the Wi-Fi icon to reveal a list of Wi-Fi networks. Tap one to
switch to it.

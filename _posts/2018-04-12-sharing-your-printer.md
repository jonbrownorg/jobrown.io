If you’ve got a perfectly usable printer that only supports USB connections that is to say non-network or non-wireless printers it’s possible to share it on your network so other Macs can print to it.

To share your printer on a Mac or with a UNIX computer the computers must be on the same network as your Mac, Mac users must be running OS X Tiger or later.
Go to:

System Preferences > Sharing

<img src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2018/printersharing/image6.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />

Check the Printer Sharing checkbox, and the Printer Sharing status will change to On.

<img src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2018/printersharing/image8.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />

In the Printers list, check the printer you want to share.

<img src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2018/printersharing/image7.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />

By default, if you share a printer, everyone on your network can use it.

To restrict printer sharing to specific users click the Add button <img src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2018/printersharing/image10.png" width="20" /> which is at the bottom of the Users list:

<img src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2018/printersharing/image9.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />

Choose a person from Users & Groups, which is a list of all the current users of your Mac.

<img src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2018/printersharing/image2.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />

You can also choose a user from Network Users / Network Groups, you will only have this option if you have set up Groups in the Users & Groups preference pane.

Or you can choose a person from the contacts list, when you do this you will be asked to create a password for the contact and they will be added to the Users & Groups preference pane, then click Create Account. When you add a contact to the Users list the “Everyone” access will be set to No Access meaning you will have to set up a user for each person you want to share the printer with.

<img src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2018/printersharing/image1.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />

You can re-enable Everyone access to the printer users by clicking the No Access option and setting it back to Can Print:

<img src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2018/printersharing/image4.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />

To remove a User from the list click on the name to select and press the remove  <img src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2018/printersharing/image3.png" width="20" /> button.

<img src="{{ site.site_cdn }}/assets/images/blog/2018/printersharing/image5.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" />

You may not remove the “Everyone” User all you can do is set the “Everyone” User to No Access.

It's common for one person in a family to handle booking airline tickets
and thus to be in charge of checking in for the flight online and
downloading boarding passes. If that's you, what's the best way to send
each iPhone-wielding person in your family their own boarding pass?
Rather than tussle with sharing the check-in confirmation email, add all
the family boarding passes to Wallet on your iPhone. Then, for each
person's boarding pass, tap the ••• button ➊, tap Pass Details ➋, tap
the share icon in the upper-right corner ➌, and share the pass via
AirDrop or any other standard method. When the person receives it,
they'll be prompted to add the pass to their Wallet app.

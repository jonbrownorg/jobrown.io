Have you found yourself composing an email message on your Mac while
staring glumly at the receipt or document you need to scan and attach to
the message? Adding that scan to the message isn't impossible, but until
macOS 10.14 Mojave, it hasn't necessarily been easy.

It's super simple now, thanks to a new Mojave feature called Continuity
Camera. It lets you take pictures or scan documents with an iPhone or
iPad running iOS 12 and have those images show up immediately on the
Mac, either in a document or on the Desktop.

### Continuity Camera Basics
---
Apart from Mojave and iOS 12, Continuity Camera requires that the
devices be on the same Wi-Fi network, have Bluetooth turned on, and be
logged in to the same Apple ID, which must use two-factor
authentication. Continuity Camera also requires explicit support in
apps, which means for the moment that it works only in Apple's apps,
including the Finder, Mail, Messages, Notes, TextEdit, Pages, Keynote,
and Numbers. We aren't aware of any third-party apps that support it
yet.

How you access Continuity Camera can vary by app, but the most common
approach is to Control- or right-click where you want the scan or photo
to go. Look either for commands for Take Photo and Scan Documents, or
for an Import from iPhone or iPad submenu, under which those commands
will be replicated for each device.

The Take Photo and Scan Documents commands may also appear in the File
menu or in an Insert menu. Plus, Mail composition windows have a
drop-down menu on the right side of the toolbar that includes those
commands.

Should you import directly into an app, or onto the Desktop? It's up to
you, of course, but adding a file to the Desktop that you can then drag
to its eventual destination gives you more options for reuse or
modification, along with backup. That could be important since the
photos and scans aren't stored on the iPhone or iPad.

### Using Continuity Camera
---
Follow these steps to use Continuity Camera to take a photo or scan a
document to your Mac. Because it's the most likely scenario, we'll
describe importing to the Desktop from an iPhone, but the steps are the
same for importing into any supported app or from an iPad.

First, Control-click the Desktop and choose either Import from iPhone \>
Take Photo or Import from iPhone \> Scan Documents. A dialog appears on
the Mac screen, telling you to use the iPhone to take the photo or scan
the document. The iPhone displays a variant of the Camera app
automatically.

If you're taking a photo, you can switch between the rear- and
front-facing cameras, pinch out to zoom, or enable the flash with the
flash button. All you need to do is tap the shutter button. If the photo
is blurry or otherwise unusable, tape Retake to try again, but if you
like it, tap Use Photo. The picture shows up immediately on your Mac as
a JPEG file.

If you're instead scanning a document, you also get a Filters button
that lets you set the scan type: color (the default), grayscale,
black-and-white, or photo. By default, the scanning interface takes a
picture automatically when it detects a document. If it moves too fast
for you, tap Auto (at the upper right) to switch to Manual. Then tap the
shutter button to capture the image, after which you may drag the
circles to identify the document corners better. Then tap Retake or Keep
Scan. If it's a multi-page document, flip the page and continue scanning
to add more pages. When you're done, tap Save to send the document to
your Mac as a PDF.

That's it! The first time or two might seem a little awkward, but once
you get the hang of Continuity Camera, it's a wonderfully quick way to
get a scan or photo onto your Mac.

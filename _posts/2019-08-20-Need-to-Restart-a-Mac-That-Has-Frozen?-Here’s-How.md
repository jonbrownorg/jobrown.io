It's extremely uncommon for a Mac to freeze or crash these days, but it
can happen. What should you do if your Mac locks up and becomes
completely unresponsive to the mouse and keyboard? The trick is to press
and hold the power button until the Mac turns off. Wait 5 or 10 seconds,
and press it again to turn the Mac back on. You will lose any unsaved
changes if you do this, so use it only as a last resort when you can't
restart normally. Look for the power button on the back of a desktop
Mac, and at the top right of the keyboard on most laptop Macs. For a
recent MacBook Air or a MacBook Pro with a Touch Bar, press and hold the
Touch ID button.

Most iOS apps and many Web sites make phone numbers "hot" so you can tap
them to call. But it's not uncommon to run across a number that's
formatted oddly or broken across a line of text such that it can't be
recognized. Just because iOS can't recognize it doesn't mean you have to
memorize the number temporarily or flip back and forth to the Phone app
to type it in it. Here's a workaround. Double-tap the start of the phone
number to select it, and then drag the rightmost blue handle to extend
the selection to the entire number. Tap Copy in the popover that appears
to copy it. Then switch to the Phone app, tap Keypad at the bottom, and
then tap in the blank white area at the top where typed numbers would
appear. When a Paste button appears, tap it, and if the Phone app
recognizes the number correctly, tap the green Call button to place the
call.

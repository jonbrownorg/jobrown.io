*The New York Times* recently published [a bombshell
article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/19/opinion/location-tracking-cell-phone.html){:rel="nofollow"}
revealing just how completely our every movement is tracked by companies
in the business of selling our locations to advertisers, marketers, and
others. Anonymous sources provided the Times with a dataset from a
single location-data company that contained 50 billion pings from the
phones of more than 12 million Americans over several months in 2016 and
2017.

This data enabled the Times reporters to track numerous people in
positions of power, including military officials, law-enforcement
officers, and high-powered lawyers. They were able to watch as people
visited the Playboy Mansion, some overnight, and they could see visitors
to celebrity estates. Once they identified any particular phone, they
could track it wherever it went. Imagine what that data could be used
for in the wrong hands.

No one intends to let unknown companies track their locations
constantly. But code built into smartphone apps does just that, often
without our knowledge. Many of the apps that request access to location
services have an entirely legitimate reason for doing so---for example,
Google Maps can't provide navigation directions unless it knows where
you are. But others want location access for less practical reasons---do
you really want to let a coffeeshop app know your location at every
moment in exchange for the occasional free latte? And some
apps---[notably weather
apps](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/gy77wy/stop-using-third-party-weather-apps){:rel="nofollow"} ---may
have a legitimate need for location information but use that data for
far more than users expect.

Even if you're not too perturbed about companies you've never heard of
knowing your exact whereabouts at all times (mostly to serve you more
targeted advertising), there's no guarantee this data couldn't fall into
the hands of foreign governments, organized crime, or hackers willing to
sell your movement patterns to an aggrieved employee, corporate spy, or
jealous ex-lover.â€‹

**Steps You Can Take to Protect Your Location Privacy**

Luckily, Apple provides controls in iOS that let you limit your
exposure. For most people, going completely dark isn't realistic. Too
many iPhone capabilities require location services, ranging from
turn-by-turn directions, to geotagging photos, to using Find My to see
if your kid has left the soccer tournament
yet.

Nevertheless, going dark is a possibility: go to Settings \> Privacy \>
Location Services and disable the Location Services switch at the top.
That turns off location services for all apps, although iOS will turn
them back on temporarily if you use Find My iPhone to enable Lost Mode.

Here's what we recommend instead.

1.Go to Settings \> Privacy \> Location Services and
scroll down to see a list of every app on your iPhone that would like to
know your location. (The same is true on the iPad, but fewer people use
their iPads as much while out and about.)

2.For each app in the list, tap the app's name to
bring up the Allow Location Access screen, which has up to four options:

-   **Never:** Prevent this app from ever
    determining your location.
-   **Ask Next Time:** The next time the app wants
    permission to track you, make it ask again.
-   **While Using the App:** Allow the app to track
    your location as long as you're actually using
    it.
-   **Always:** Let the app track your location at
    all times, even when you're not using it.

3.Tap one of the options to select it, and then tap
Back to return to the list.

We can't tell you exactly how to configure each app since everyone has a
different set and different levels of privacy worry. However, here is
some advice:

-   Apps and other entries from Apple are generally
    safe because Apple has an extremely strong privacy stance and
    excellent security against hacks. But, down in System Services at
    the bottom, we'd turn off Location-Based Apple Ads and Popular Near
    Me---even if Apple is collecting this data anonymously, it's still
    being used to sell things to you, not to provide useful services to
    you.
-   For most apps, change the Allow Location Access
    setting to Ask Next Time to force each app to prompt you again. If
    it asks at a point where it's reasonable that it would need to know
    your location, such as Yelp wanting to show you nearby restaurants,
    grant it. If you don't understand why it's asking, or if the request
    seems weak ("To show you which wines are available for purchase in
    your area."), deny the request.
-   With apps that obviously need location
    services, such a parking app that needs to know which area you're
    in, change the setting to While Using App and see if that meets your
    needs.
-   Only if you clearly need to allow a particular
    app to track your location in the background---turn-by-turn
    navigation apps are the most common---should you change that setting
    to Always. Almost no apps should be given such power, and many won't
    even provide the option.

There's one unusual item in the list: Safari Websites. It's a master
switch that lets Web sites loaded in Safari ask for your location.
That's probably not a major privacy concern, but few Web sites provide
sufficiently useful location-based features (mostly for finding nearby
chain store outlets) that it's worth bothering.

In the end, go with your gut. If thinking about a particular app or
company potentially recording your location constantly gives you the
creeps, turn it off and either find an alternative or do without.
Legislation may be the only solution in the end, but for now, we can
take steps like these to protect ourselves.

Let's get one thing straight. You know that you should never, ever share
your iPhone or iPad passcode with anyone you don't trust implicitly,
like a spouse or adult child, right? That's because, with your iOS
passcode, someone could change your Apple ID password, and if you use
iCloud for email, completely steal or otherwise abuse your online
identity. (Scared? Good. If you've given anyone your passcode, go change
it right now. We'll wait.)

So if sharing your passcode is such a terrible idea, how do you let
someone else use your iPhone or iPad temporarily? Perhaps you want to
let your kid play a game in the car while you focus on tricky winter
driving. Or maybe you time running races with an iPhone app and want
someone to do the timing without giving them full access to your iPhone.
Whatever the reason you want to give someone limited access to a single
app in iOS 13, the solution is Guided Access.​

**Enabling and Configuring Guided Access**

To turn Guided Access on, navigate to Settings \> Accessibility \>
Guided Access (it's near the bottom), and flick the switch. While you're
here, check out the remaining settings:

-   **Passcode Settings:** Create a passcode for
    getting out of Guided Access here (it can be different than your
    normal one), and choose whether you can use Touch ID or Face ID to
    exit as well.
-   **Time Limits:** You don't set time limits
    here, but you can set audio and spoken warnings before the time runs
    out.
-   **Accessibility Shortcut:** Enable this if you
    also use triple-click for another Accessibility Shortcut like
    Magnifier.
-   **Display Auto-Lock:** Choose how long the
    device can be inactive before the screen turns off. If the Guided
    Access user wakes up the device, they'll still be in Guided Access.

With those settings configured, switch to the desired app and
triple-click the side or Home button, and if necessary, tap Guided
Access in the Accessibility Shortcut list. You can do five things:

**Set session-specific options:** Tap Options in
the lower-right corner to access various switches. If they're disabled:

-   **Side Button or Sleep/Wake Button:** The user
    can't put the device to sleep.
-   **Volume Buttons:** The user can't change the
    volume.
-   **Motion:** The screen doesn't change from the
    orientation (portrait or landscape) it was in when you started
    Guided Access.
-   **Touch:** The user can't do anything with the
    screen at all---probably most appropriate for letting a young child
    watch a video.
-   **Dictionary Lookup:** Prevents word lookups in
    some apps.

**Set time limits:** At the bottom of the Options
list, tap Time Limit and set an amount of time after which the device
can't be used until you enter the Guided Access passcode.

**Disable specific areas on the screen:** Draw
circles around parts of the screen you want to make off-limits to the
user. After making a circle, you can move it by dragging it, resize it
by dragging any of its handles, or remove it by tapping its X button.

**Start/Resume Guided Access:** In the upper-right
corner, tap Start. If you haven't yet set a passcode, you'll be prompted
to do that.

**Exit the setup screen:** In the upper-left
corner, tap End.​

**Using Guided Access**

Once you tap Start, iOS tells you it\'s entering Guided Access and lets
you use the current app with the restrictions you've applied. If you
decide that the restrictions aren't right, triple-click the side or Home
button to return to the setup screen. When you're done, tap Resume in
the upper-right corner.

To leave Guided Access, triple-click the side or Home button, enter the
passcode, and in the setup screen, tap End in the upper-left corner.

That's it! Once you understand the various limitations of Guided Access,
you'll be able to turn it on and off quickly whenever you need to let
someone use your iPhone or iPad for a while.

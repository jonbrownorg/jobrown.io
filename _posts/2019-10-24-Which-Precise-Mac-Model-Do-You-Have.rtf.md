Apple likes to keep Mac names simple, but that's not always helpful. For
instance, if you want to add RAM to your Mac, it's not good enough to
know that it's an iMac. You'll need to know that it's a 27-inch iMac
with Retina display from late 2014. To find that out, choose About This
Mac from the Apple menu. In some cases, you might even need to know the
model identifier, which is a numeric code that's accessible if you click
the System Report button in the About This Mac window, and then click
Hardware at the top left of the System Information window. It will be
something like iMac15,1.

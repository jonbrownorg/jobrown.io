Did you know that the word for the irrational fear of Friday the 13th is
*paraskevidekatriaphobia*? Neither did we, but what that supposedly
unlucky day is good for---whenever it rolls around---is reminding us to
test our backup systems. If something does go wrong, backups can save
your bacon, but only if they're actually working. So on Friday the 13th
this month, take a few minutes to make sure you can restore files from
Time Machine, see if you can boot from your bootable duplicate, and
generally verify that your data really is being backed up successfully.
And if you've already missed the 13th, today is a fine day to make up
for it with a quick test.

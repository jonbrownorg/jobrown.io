We've all had it happen. "Can I use your Mac for a minute to check my
email?" The answer can be "Yes," but to keep people from poking around
on your Mac, have your visitor log in as Guest. To enable the Guest
account, go to System Preferences \> Users & Groups. If the lock at the
bottom left is closed, click it and enter your admin credentials. Then
click Guest User in the list, and select "Allow guests to log in to this
computer." To switch to the Guest account, go to the Apple menu and
choose Log Out *YourAccountName* to access the login screen. Your guest
can then click the Guest User icon, at which point they'll have a clean
account to work in. When they log out, the account---including any files
they created or downloaded---will be deleted, thus protecting their
privacy as well.

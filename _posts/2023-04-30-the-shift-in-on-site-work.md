I can't think of many things that have to be done in person. It almost seemed like it was a fear of mine that if the client never saw me, that they would never see like the value  wasn't there in their eyes.  

Exactly. And that goes back to a mindset that probably was embedded very long ago. And I have a similar kind of origin story of doing things the way  the company that I worked for did them and the way colleagues did them.

And  this goes back 15, 16, 17 years or longer. Obviously the world is just a much different place.  

I'm coming from where remote support was telling somebody what to do and click on by phone and having to have the whole OS mapped in my head somewhere  and then one day having Mac Helpmate be an option  and  and as difficult and sometimes    it would be less than reliable and it would be frustrating, but it was  miraculous that  now I can actually connect remotely.

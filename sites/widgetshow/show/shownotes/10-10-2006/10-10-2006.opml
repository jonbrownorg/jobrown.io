        <outline text="While searching Google, I noticed they have some great applications like Sketch up, Picasa, Google talk, and more. The sad thing was, they were only Windows-compatible. While trying many different ways to see if I could get any of these Google applications on my Mac, I type in the address bar, www.google.com—mac. &lt;http://www.google.com/mac.&gt; And it works! A whole page with all of the Mac-comptible Google applications (Google notifier, Google toolbar, Google SketchUp, Picasa Web Albums Uploader, Google Earth, Google Widgets). I highly recommend trying these free applications out because they pack a lot for freeware. I just wish I could of found this page of Mac-comptible Google apps earlier."/>

        <outline text="If you are a fan of the Dashboard, like I am then you already know there are some great sites for listing and downloading widgets. This site is no exception. Widget World, is a great website that is always updated and displays download links to widgets on the web. They have many widgets listed, and you have the choice as a developer to link your widget to your own server or upload it to their servers for hosting. Thats a very useful feature. They display the top most downloaded widgets as well as the top ten most recent widgets and they also have a members area that allows you to get information from Widget World directly. They also have a great widget news area that serves as a blog about widgets and also about widget related topics."/>

      <outline text="Apple Widget Submission Process" MediaLinks="Submit a Widget &lt;https://adcweb.apple.com/downloads/&gt;">
        <outline text="Now getting into the news, we talked about the new widget submission process over at Apple.com from what I have been hearing and seeing many people are satisfied with this process. I am re-submitting all my widgets but it seems since this system has been in place, Apple has not added any new widgets to their “Just Added” area. Very odd, having seen this area updated at least once a week, I guess we just need to be patient and see perhaps they are still working out bugs in the system, or perhaps its overloaded their system with everyone re-submitting, so it takes longer to validate each widget. A user pointed out that with this new system they are discouraging submissions from people under 18, which was never the case before. Seems strange, some really great widgets have come from teens out there and I hope that this does not discourage teens from trying to develop some great widgets."/>

      <outline text="Another Widget Blog" MediaLinks="thewidgetblog.blogspot.com &lt;http://thewidgetblog.blogspot.com/&gt;">
        <outline text="I was browsing the web for some cool widget news the other day, and found that there is another widget blog out there, that I have never seen before but has been around since January or so. The blog is called “The Widget Blog” and the link can be found in the show notes. It’s a really great blog that has a “Widget of the week” and the ability for you, the developer to submit your widget for review. This is cool, and I encourage all of you to check it out, and help support our bloggers out there. Each widget site, offers its own set of features that we can all appreciate, so check them out and again support independent writers."/>

        <outline text="Have you gotten a new Macbook, have you noticed that it has started making mooing sounds. That’s right you heard right Many users have observed that their Apple MacBook makes a mooing sound. The fan starting up and then immediately stopping over and over again causes the mooing sound. The mooing noise only happens when the processor is between 65 and 67 degrees Celsius..."/>

        <outline text="Joshua Scott Emmonds has recently posted an article over at the O’rielly blog, talking about the widget developer and their role in creating functional dashboard widgets. To quote the article “What most users (and some widget developers) don’t realize, though, is that Dashboard does not guarantee resources consumed by widgets will be freed once it is hidden. It is the responsibility of each individual widget to keep track of its processing and return it to the system when put away."/>

        <outline text="Another story in the news, is about a guy who walked into an Apple store and started using a Macbook, and he noticed that the store had locked down some features of OSX so that people could not mess with them. One such feature was opening Safari. He then opened dashboard and launched the “Widget Broswer” widget, which has an option to go to get more widgets. He pressed this button and it automatically launched Safari, something he could not do prior with the restrictions in place."/>

        <outline text="Amnesty Singles, is a spawn off of Amnesty Browser by Messa Dynamics, what Amnesty Browser does, is it lets you add widget functionaility to OSX Panther which was 10.3. Basically Amnesty singles allows you to run a widget outside of the dashboard area. It builds an application based upon your widget. This widget now an application, now runs as an application with an icon in the dock"/>

        <outline text="Let's start by making a javascript function, let's call it &quot;CountDown&quot;. (Javascript is case sensetive.)&#10;function CountDown() { //A function called &quot;CountDown&quot;&#10;}&#10;We will add 4 rows of code to this function.&#10;Row 1&#10;first, you must understand that when one calls for the time in javascript, one calls for a javascript function that counts all the mili seconds from 1970, so to make the mili seconds into days, one must divide them with a formula, the first row of code will be that formula:&#10;var Time = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24;&#10;You will notice I wrote var time = before the formula, this assign the answer to the formula into a variable named Time. If you don't know what a variable is, think of it as a place to store a value for later use.&#10;Row 2&#10;The next line of code will calculate how many days there has been since 1970&#10;var FutureDate = Math.floor(Date.parse(&quot;15 Jul 2005&quot;) / Time );&#10;Was this confusing? Let's learn it step by step.&#10;var FutureDate = // you should know what this does, as I said before, it stores the calculation into &quot;FutureDate&quot;.&#10;Math.floor(Date.parse(&quot;15 Jul 2005&quot;)); // This code gets the number of mili seconds from 1970 to 15 July 2005, it's here you will put your Future date, for example, if you want a countdown to 14/8 2005, just write &quot;14 aug 2005&quot; instaid.&#10;To make mili seconds into days, just divide it with your variable Time, like this:&#10;var FutureDate = Math.floor(Date.parse(&quot;15 Jul 2005&quot;) / Time );&#10;Row 3&#10;The next line will tell us how many days there has been until today, it's pretty much the same as the line before, but instaid of writing a date, you add a function that knows which date it is today, you can see the different function for your self.&#10;var Today = Math.floor((new Date()).getTime() / Time);&#10;A short repetition of what it does:&#10;Math.floor((new Date()).getTime()); // Todays date&#10;Time // The calculation to make mili seconds into days&#10;var Today = // stores the answer to the calculation into the variable Today&#10;Row 4&#10;The last line is quite simple, it takes your Futura Date and substract Today. To clerify: The amount of days there is between 1970 and the date you wrote minus the days the number of days between 1970 and today.&#10;It looks like this: return FutureDate - Today;&#10;Returns the value of FutureDate - Today.&#10;The code should look like this:&#10;function CountDown() {&#10;var Time = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24; //Formula for making mili seconds into days&#10;var FutureDate = Math.floor(Date.parse(&quot;15 Jul 2005&quot;) / Time ); //Calculates how many days that has past from 1970 to the specefied date&#10;var Today = Math.floor((new Date()).getTime() / Time); //Calculates how many days that has past from 1970 to today&#10;return FutureDate - Today; // if one takes the &quot;FutureDate&quot; and substract &quot;Today&quot;, one get the days left :), this returns the right value&#10;}&#10;Now we need to link this function to the html document so the actual value will show. To do so, you will need to open your HTML document again and write the following code in the &lt;body&gt; tag.&#10;&lt;script type='text/javascript'&gt;&#10;&lt;/script&gt;&#10;This tells your HTML document that you want to use javascript in that section.&#10;And the javascript your will need is:&#10;document.write(CountDown());&gt;&#10;The code should look like this:&#10;&lt;html&gt;&#10;&lt;head&gt;&#10;&lt;script type='text/javascript' src='javascript.js' /&gt; // Includes the javascript code in document javascript.js, in other words, your javascript function&#10;&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt; &#10;@import &quot;stylesheet.css&quot;; &#10;&lt;/style&gt; &#10;&lt;/head&gt;&#10;&lt;body&gt; &#10;&#10;&lt;script type='text/javascript'&gt; // Defines a javascript part of your document&#10;document.write(CountDown()); // document.write = write in document. Write the function CountDown in document&#10;&lt;/script&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;/body&gt;&#10;&lt;/html&gt;"/>

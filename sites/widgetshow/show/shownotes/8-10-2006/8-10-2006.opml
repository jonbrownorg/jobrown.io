        <outline text="Clips and flicks&#10;Create your own website widget using Web Clip in Safari for Leopard. Just visit your favorite site and click the “Open in Dashboard” button in Safari. Dashboard launches a new clip of the site in a customizable widget. From there, you can resize your Web Clip and choose from a handful of window themes. And since your Web Clip is always live, it acts just like the website it was clipped from. Dashboard for Leopard also introduces a movie widget that finds movies and showtimes in less time than it takes to make popcorn.&#10;Widgets wherever&#10;Get yourself a .Mac account and your Dashboard preferences can follow you from Mac to Mac. With Dashboard syncing in Leopard, when you make a change to your Dashboard preferences, Leopard automatically keeps everything in sync across every Mac you use.&#10;Ready, set, widget&#10;Ever wish you could make your very own Dashboard widget? Say hello to Dashcode. With it, you can get a widget up and running in minutes, even if you’ve never written a line of code in your life. Choose from a handful of Dashcode widget templates — including a countdown timer, RSS feed, photocast, podcast, or gauge — or create a widget from scratch with a blank template. Drag in an RSS link and your widget populates with a full feed. Drag in a photocast URL and your widget transforms into a self-contained slideshow. Drag in a podcast link and you can start playing the feed right from your widget.&#10;When your widget is ready for prime time, Dashcode packages up all the your files and the Apple-provided resources required to deploy your widget to Dashboard or submit it to Apple.com."/>

        <outline text="Dash Clipping is a universal widget tool that allows you to turn any part of any web page into a Dashboard widget with a couple of clicks. Download it here. Feedback to the usual address.If this sounds familiar it's because it's a shameless rip-off of the new Web Clipping tool that's due in Leopard and that I knocked together over the last 24 hours. If you watch the video on that page (and the keynote) carefully, you'll realise all Apple's doing is loading the whole web page but only showing part of it. There's nothing clever about what they're doing, and there's nothing clever about my version either, though I did have to write part of it in Cocoa to get in working (you can almost do it with just an IFRAME, but not quite)."/>

        <outline text="Have you ever wanted to experience widgets but you were on a PC and yet did not want to have to run out and install Yahoo’s Widget Engine. Then look no furuther there is a solution currently in development called Mooglets, these great little widgets run right in your web browser so you do not need a Mac to enjoy widgets anymore. Moogletts looks and feels very similar, to the Dashboard in OSX Tiger. Now they are not an exact match, but you can add Mooglets, save the positions of your mooglets, and configure mogglets right on screen to do what you need them to do. Currently there are two types of clocks, a digg rss reader, a mint reader, and a google search to choose from. These are all customizable and very fun to play with. Check them out!"/>

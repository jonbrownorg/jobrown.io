        <outline text="The Solar Viewer widget allows you to see today's images of the Sun on your computer desktop. These near realtime images come from NASA/ESA's SOHO missions, NASA TRACE satellite, and the Big Bear Observatory. A Mac OS X dashboard widget was designed and developed along with a Yahoo! Widget that works with both Mac and PC.&#10;The Yahoo! widget (along with an earlier prototype) developed early in 2006 has received over 80,000 downloads combined. The widget is based on the Sun-Earth Connection Media Viewer, a Flash-based interactive application developed with NASA in 2004."/>

        <outline text="Today's smart idea: a VW-branded downloadable widget that pipes in local events and activities. It's persistent (lasts long on your desktop), branded (VW Rabbit), on-strategy (money-saving ideas for city folk), and cool (sweet design and execution). Well done, VW &amp; CP&amp;B!"/>

      <outline text="Thanksgiving Widgets">
        <outline text="My own rant about why there aren't any thanksgiving widgets. I was sure to find a widget that would let you watch the Macy's thanksgiving day parade in the dashboard. Or perhaps a turkey, or pilgrim or something, but to my dismay, there are not any thanksgiving widgets out there. Where has thanksgiving gone? Have we forgotten about this very important family holiday, a time of gathering together and enjoying each others company. Lets reflect on the true spirit of Thanksgiving this holiday season."/>

      <outline text="BeRuler Widget" MediaLinks="Snatch Em’ &lt;http://www.jaij.net/downloads.php&gt;">
        <outline text="Two of my favorite widgets of all time has been the Snatch Em’ and Snatch It widgets. These widgets allow you to download files from all over the internet in one simple click. Its a great widget backed by a great function. I was simply sick of dealing with pages with loads of media files or links to files and wanted the ability to quickly download all the files referred to on a page, both inline and linked to. Do you recognize any of these situations?&#10;* You get to a page that is basically a “folder view” with 100 of links to files and you have to click every one of them or right/ctrl-click and download every one to be able to view them.&#10;* You get to a page with an inline video and you want to download it. Unfortunately there is no way of downloading the video straight from the page which forces you to go into the source and start looking for the filename.&#10;* You enter a gallery full of images that you want to save to your hard drive all of them being forced to right/ctrl-click all of them to be able to download them. I was in all of those situations ALL the time and the solution for it is a Mac OS X Dashboard Widget that used the XMLHttpRequest object in JavaScript to download the source, Regular Expressions to find the file referrences and the terminal program Curl, built in to BSD and OS X, to download the individual files. Quite simple isn’t it? icon_smile"/>

        <outline text="First, as with text in many OS X applications, you can get the search box to show you possible completions based on the characters you’ve typed so far. How? Just press and hold Control, Option, or Command, then press the Escape key, and you’ll see a drop-down list of possible completions. Scroll or arrow down to the word you’d like to use, press Return, and its definition will appear."/>
        <outline text="The other trick with the Dictionary widget involves what you can do once you have a definition visible in the widget. Type rain for instance, and you’ll see that rain is “moisture condensed from the atmosphere that falls visibly in separate drops.” And a very clear definition it is! But see that half-circle with the “R” on it sticking out on the left edge of the widget? Click that, and you’ll see a list of other known words and phrases that start with “rain.” Click any of those words to jump to their definition; click the “R” again (before clicking another word), and you’ll switch back to the standard definition of “rain.”"/>
        <outline text="Toggle the widget from Dictionary mode to Thesaurus mode, and the same trick works—here it will show you a list of other words in the thesaurus that are similar to the chosen word. Toggle the “R” again, and you’re back to the thesaurus entries for “rain.”"/>

        <outline text="We all know that Apple Dashboard widgets give your Mac something of a heads-up display, combining multiple sources of information in a single at-a-glance interface. But while Apple introduced its desktop widget platform in 2005 as part of Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger), what you may not have realized is that the concept far predates even OS X, going way back to the dawn of the Macintosh itself."/>

      <outline text="Dashboard Patent for Cube Like Interface" _note="Filed February 1, 2006 under the heading &quot;Multiple Dashboards,&quot; the 45-page patent application lists the Mac makers vice president of platform experience Scott Forstall amongst the engineers credited with the proposed interface concepts.&#10;&#10;While the existing versions of Apples Mac OS X operating system offers a single repository and graphical interface view for managing Dashboard widgets, Forstalls proposal would expand the concept to allow users to create and configure multiple Dashboards views to manage the increasing number of widgets available for download across the Internet. &#10;&#10;For example, one Dashboard view could contain widgets related to work, while another would house those widgets related only to personal matters. Different trigger events -- such as different key combinations and menu selections -- would be used to trigger various Dashboards workspaces into view. &#10;&#10;According to the filing, different Dashboards could contain one or more of the same widgets and &quot;state&quot; information for a widget could be maintained separately for each Dashboard in which the widget appears, or it can be commonly maintained across all Dashboards in which the widget appears.&#10;&#10;&quot;Different Dashboards can be available or owned for different users of a computer or other electronic device, such that each user can only access their own Dashboard(s),&quot; Apple said in the filing. &quot;A user can specify a Dashboard as being available to other users, if desired. A user can also specify, for any or all of the Dashboards he or she creates, whether other users are permitted to make changes to the Dashboard(s).&quot;" MediaLinks="www.appleinsider.com—apple_filing_depicts_interactive_dashboard_cube_interface.html &lt;http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/07/05/03/apple_filing_depicts_interactive_dashboard_cube_interface.html&gt;"/>

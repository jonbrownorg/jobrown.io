        <outline text="If you’re using OS X 10.4, here’s something you may not have realized about Dashboard: It supports drag-and-drop. Many widgets will accept dropped objects; for those who like using drag-and-drop, this is welcome news. Dragging text and images to Dashboard is just about as a simple as dragging them anywhere else—just select the object or text you wish to drag, click-and-hold, start dragging, press F12 to activate Dashboard, and then navigate to the desired widget’s work area and drop the selection. Note that the desired widget must already be open in Dashboard; you can’t open a widget from the Dashboard bar while dragging something."/>

      <outline text="Eben Eliason talks about the GAS widget" MediaLinks="www.interdimensionmedia.com—index.html &lt;http://www.interdimensionmedia.com/gas3/index.html&gt;">
        <outline text="Ever since I have started using widgets in the Dashboard interface one of the widgets that really amazed me was the Gas Widget. This widget is super functional for a quick and easy task that we all need on a daily basis and that is finding reasonable or the cheapest gas price within a certain radius or zip code location. Now I have been using this widget now for about a year and it has saved me lots of time, money and frustration. I really love the simple interface, the super fast scrolling numbers when it refreshes to look for my latest search and I also love the ability to search with any zip code in the USA.&#10;If you are like me and want to save some cash, as well as have a functional widget on your dashboard that does what it does well than look no further. You will be instantly amazed! Version 3.0 will be coming soon and will boast a lot of new features so check that out also!"

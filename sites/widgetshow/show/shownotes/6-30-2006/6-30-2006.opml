        <outline text="“ While checking out gadgets last night, I noticed that Mac Widgets are pretty much the same thing as gadgets, a little html with some Java code to get things done. My question is, has anyone been working on or is anyone even though of possibly porting their widgets to gadgets for use in the sidebar? ”"/>

        <outline text="“ The W.A.S (Widget Alert System) was created by Taco Widgets. Taco Widgets is an innovative company that is always trying to come out with the latest technology both for their own widgets but for the dashboard in general. The W.A.S system is a way of adding alerts into your widget that will prompt the user for a response. This is a cool way to auto update a widget, or adding a time event. ”"/>

        <outline text="There are 5 properties that should be included in a widget. 1. CFBundleDisplayName - The widget display-name 2. CFBundleIdentifier - The widget identifier 3. CFBundleName - The widget name 4. CFBundleVersion - The widget version 5. MainHTML - A link to the html file it should load on start, if you are into web, you can think of the file as index.html ”&#10;When the plist file is ready, we should make a background image for your widget. Think carefully now because this will be the foundation of your widget. There are some things you should think about when you make the graphics for your widget.&#10;1. Don’t make it larger than it has to be! 2. Try to make it blend in with dashboard if it suits the widget. 3. Make the shadow look somewhat the same as the rest of the widgets&#10;When you are done with the background for your widget, save it as 24-bit PNG. This image format supports alpha channel and is the best choice."/>

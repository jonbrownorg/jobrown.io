        <outline text="If you didn't know about it, then yes it is true. Our marketeers have managed to name 3 slightly different things with the same name. I can sort of see where they are coming from, since in all 3 cases we are talking about task specifics mini-applets that are not quite full blown applications but are also not web pages so “gadgets” seemed appropriate for each category.&#10;&#10;I am talking of course about (note the spelling/casing!)&#10;* live gadgets (web)&#10;* SideShow gadgets (Vista)&#10;* Sidebar gadgets (Vista)&#10;&#10;The compatibility between these is not there *yet*. Each has its own API that the other two hosts will not understand. SideShow gadgets are probably more removed from the other two. Live gadgets can be made under certain circumstances to run in Sidebar (via an iframe) but the vice versa story is not as good. I am being vague on the compatibility as I know it will get better in the future and the current story is ever changing. But here I am talking about (in)compatibility when I haven’t introduced each one of them!"/>

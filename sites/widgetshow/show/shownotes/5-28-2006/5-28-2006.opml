      <outline text="WidgetTerm one of the best ways to access the Terminal in the Dashboard.">
        <outline text="WidgetTerm is the terminal widget that brings fully functional UNIX shell on the dashboard. This is a great widget, and here are some of my impressions. Firstly, its clean and very easy to use, and simply does what it advertises allows you to type command line actions in terminal within the dashboard. If you use the terminal then I recommend downloading this great little widget. This widget uses CocoaTechTerminal framework, which is based on iTerm, the open source terminal emulater in Cocoa. Download it here WidgetTerm and write your own review. Send us your comments to widgetshow@gmail.com &lt;mailto:widgetshow@gmail.com&gt;"/>

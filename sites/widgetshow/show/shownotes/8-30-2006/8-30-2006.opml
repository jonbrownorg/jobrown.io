We aren't revealing many details right now, but we will be updating our home page with different blurbs to tease you. ;) So feast on those for now, and keep an eye on us in case we do something crazy."

        <outline text="Have you ever wanted to experience widgets but you were on a PC and yet did not want to have to run out and install Yahoo’s Widget Engine. Then look no furuther there is a solution currently in development called Mooglets, these great little widgets run right in your web browser so you do not need a Mac to enjoy widgets anymore. Moogletts looks and feels very similar, to the Dashboard in OSX Tiger. Now they are not an exact match, but you can add Mooglets, save the positions of your mooglets, and configure mogglets right on screen to do what you need them to do. Currently there are two types of clocks, a digg rss reader, a mint reader, and a google search to choose from. These are all customizable and very fun to play with. Check them out!"/>

        <outline text="If you don’t know about it by now it means you have been very new to the widget scene or you have been living under a rock, but for the last few years one of the best online resources for widget gurus, developers, designers, and fans has been Dashboardwidgets.com. This site is amazing combined with a forum, a showcase area for the widgets to be voted on, commented on and even hosted. Along with some of the most amazing discussions and useful information in its forum archives. I have always, been very impressed by the services that this site offers and not only that but how great all of the services of the entire MUG network. They also have iCompositions.com and macdesktops.net which are other great sites along with the newest addition Leopard Tracker"/>

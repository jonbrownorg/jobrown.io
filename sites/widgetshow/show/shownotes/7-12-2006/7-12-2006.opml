        <outline text="“With the release of Mac OS X 10.4.7, Apple implemented a new widget authentication tool that seeks to verify that you have not downloaded a malicious widget. The tool, dashboardadvisoryd, contacts Apple’s servers approximately every eight hours and compares your widgets with those available on Apple’s own widget site."/>

        <outline text="After I installed 10.4.7 and restarted the computer, it hung up during the restart. It showed the blue progress bar filling up the blank area all the way to the end and then just stayed there for 2 or 3 minutes. At that point I shut down the computer, let it sit for a 30 seconds or so and then started it up again. Same result. I did this twice before I reverted to backup. I’m back to 10.4.6 now and will probably stay there until I hear how others are doing."/>

        <outline text="A widget is basically a website, you make it with the same scripting language, that is; xhtml, css and javascript. There are also other methods you can use for certain things that are more advanced and/or talk to the system itself.&#10;But, we will concentrate on the basics, XHTML and CSS in this tutorial, I will also introduce some javascript later.&#10;This is the elements required for the html: (the slash ends html tags)&#10;// defines HTML&#10;// defines the header of the widget, in here you will put the CSS code (Stylesheet, it’s purpose is to design the structure you build with html)&#10;//Tells the widget that you want t import Javascript code from the file “javascript.js” (every widget needs some javascript code to work properly)&#10;&#10;&#10;//defines the body selection, between and , you will build the widgets visible parts.&#10;&#10;Save this file as name.html and remember, the plist file I talked about in the first chapter needs to find this file.&#10;Now, this widget does not work yet, there is one more thing you must implement, and that is the background image named “Default.png”, you do this by creating a file named “stylesheet.css” and write the following code in the file:&#10;body { // Tells the widget that you want to put the following CSS functions into your document’s body tag&#10;background-image: url(’Default.png’); //inserts the image Default.png as background&#10;}&#10;You widget should work now. To start your widget, name the folder containing the files to “name.wdgt” and OS X makes a widget bundle out of it.&#10;To complete this chapter, you’ll need to write “Hello World” icon_smile . It’s done this way:&#10;// defines HTML&#10;// defines the header of the widget, in here you will put the CSS code (Stylesheet, it’s purpose is to design the structure you build with html)&#10;//Tells the widget that you want t import Javascript code from the file “javascript.js” (every widget needs some javascript code to work properly)&#10;&#10;&#10;//defines the body selection, between and , you will build the widgets visible parts.&#10;Hello World! //To write text in a widget, just write it icon_smile&#10;&#10;But, you may want to change the font, this is done by using CSS. Look at the example beneeth:&#10;body { // Again, we add our functions to “body” which makes them apply to the document.&#10;background-image: url(’Default.png’); //inserts the image Default.png as background&#10;font-family: Lucida grande; //sets the standard font of the document to “Lucida grande”&#10;font-size: 14px; //Font Size 14&#10;font-weight: bold; //Makes the text bold&#10;color: #000033; //Set the color of the text, this is done using Hex-code&#10;}&#10;Now, you may choose which of the elements you want to apply and the value of them, for further study of CSS, visit w3schools.com"/>

Taco Widgets is an innovative company that is always trying to come out with the latest technology both for their own widgets but for the dashboard in general. The W.A.S system is a way of adding alerts into your widget that will prompt the user for a response. This is a cool way to auto update a widget, or adding a time event."/>

        <outline text="Did you know that you can run a widget without permanently installing it? After downloading (from Apple’s site or others) and expanding a widget, a double-click launches the widget installer. A dialog then appears with two options: Cancel and Install. Click Cancel, and nothing happens; click Install, and the widget is moved to your user’s Library/Widgets folder, ready for use in Dashboard. However, if you hold Command and Option when the dialog is onscreen, the Install button will change to Run, allowing you to only run the widget. Select this, and it opens in the Dashboard layer, but it’s not moved to your Widgets folder. Ta-da!”"/>

We give this a 5 out of 5 star rating, its really great and it works well with the Amazon site to get the most accurate album artwork for your music library."/>

        <outline text="“ From the looks of it, this app is not a consumer oriented app for widget creation. It looks like it will be an IDE for dashboard widgets with very nice WYSIWYG tools. Even the name, which is reminiscent of Xcode, hints at this. Not that it will be a bad thing, but it is not what I first thought it will be. I am confident that there a lot of end users (read as: non-programmers) who have their own ideas for really simple but specialized dashboard widgets. They will benefit greatly from a consumer oriented widget creation app. Sadly, that app won't be dashcode. But the sadder thing is that this mythical consumer oriented widget creating app that I desire, seems nowhere in sight. ”"/>

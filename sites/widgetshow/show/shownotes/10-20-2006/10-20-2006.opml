        <outline text="A fun and challenging game for all ages. The object is simple. Click on the blocks, and don’t hit a mine. When you click on a block, and it shows a blank spot, you’re fine. There are no mines next to you, and by next to you, that means left, right, up, down, or diagonal of that square. A “1” means that square is next to one mine. A “2” means two, and so on. Try to clear all the spots without hitting any mines! If you think you know where a mine is, right click (CTRL+click) on the square once. If you aren’t sure, enable question markers on the backside, then right click on a square twice. It’s simple, fun, and sleek."/>

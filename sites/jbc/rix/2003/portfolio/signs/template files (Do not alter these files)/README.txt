Use the files in this area to create more pages for each portfolio area.

Step 1.
First you will notice that there is a file in the Graphics directory called hands.html. This is the first page in the business hand portfolio area. To add an additional page to this portfolio please alter the link at the bottom of hand.html. The link is as follows...

<a href="nextpage.html">See More</a>

change that link to the following

<a href="hand2.html">See More</a>

Step 2.
Now open hands.html from the template directory in notepad and the rename it to hand2.html in the graphics directory. 

Step 3.
Now you have added an additional page to your hand portfolio. Do the same thing to alter the other portfolio pages.

Use the files in this area to create more pages for each portfolio area.

Step 1.
First you will notice that there is a file in the Graphics directory called customs.html. This is the first page in the business custom portfolio area. To add an additional page to this portfolio please alter the link at the bottom of custom.html. The link is as follows...

<a href="nextpage.html">See More</a>

change that link to the following

<a href="custom2.html">See More</a>

Step 2.
Now open customs.html from the template directory in notepad and the rename it to custom2.html in the graphics directory. 

Step 3.
Now you have added an additional page to your custom portfolio. Do the same thing to alter the other portfolio pages.

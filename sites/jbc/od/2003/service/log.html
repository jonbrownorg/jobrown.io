<font size=2><b>About Logo Design</b>
<br>
Need a new identity for your company or just a new logo. We can help you out! We pride ourselves with being able to create custom and high quality logos that define and shape the companies future. We can create any logo at any style that you like. We wont stop designing until your satisfied.
<br><br>
<b>Our Process</b>
<br>
First we ask you what your company is about. What does it make and what does it want to accomplish with its new identity. Secondly we create some rough sketches that are then shown to the client and approved for the next steop. Third, we take these rough sketches and we create a computer rendered version. If the client likes this then we create a final vector version ready for print or web.<br><br>
<b>Logo Re-Creation</b>
<br>
Many people dont need a new logo, what they need is to have their logo re-created so that they can have it printed. Some designing firms dont give the client the original file so its difficult to use that file for everything the company needs. We can do this for you at a minimal charge of 50.00.<br><br>
<b>What software do you use?</b>
<br>
Mostly we use Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop. We can recreate your old logo from just a paper copy of the logo.</font>

<font size=2><b>About Tee Shirts</b>
<br>
We can take your design or logo and create a tee shirt. What good is a tee shirt to you though? Well think of this, its the best form of free advertising for your company or corporation. If you create tee shirts for give away's, then people will remember your business. If you create tee shirts for your staff then people will see their tee shirts. Its the best way to get your name out there. Our tee shirts come in a variety of different colors and different sizes with any design front or back!
<br><br>
<b>Silk Screening</b>
<br>
We do not use iron on transfers. We use the process of silk screening. For this a silk transfer is used to press ink through onto your shirt. this ensures a high quality tee shirt in the end. However the silk for the screens do cost money. A 50.00 screen charge will be added to every order per design. <br><br>
<b>Colors</b>
<br>
We can do single color on the front or back. 2-3 colors front or back or Full color front or back. Or 1-2 or 3 colors front and back and Full color front and back. We can do it all. However there is a minimum order for full color shirts of 200qty. Single color minimum order starts at 75ct.<br><br>
<b>What software do you use?</b>
<br>
Mostly we use Adobe Illustrator. If you have graphics not in this format then we can still use them. If we have a problem with a file then we will let you know.</font>

<font size=2><b>About Color Printing</b>
<br>
Our color printing service is one of our most popular. We can take a pre-designed business card and print it out for you at a very minimal cost. Brochures, Stationary, and even catalogs. Anything you need, photos and more. Usually the color printing service is bundled in with a design project but if you already have the files or an original of the file then we can print it for you.

<b>Four Color Presses</b>
<br>
We do not use a color photo copier, please keep this in mind when you ask for this service. We do send this to our press department and they do run these professionally through a press for the highest quality. Because we do this the minimum order you can buy is 50ct and the most is 10,000ct for any one item. It also takes about a week to a week and a half to process this so if you need something rushed then you will enjoy our other service.<br><br>
<b>Rush Service</b>
<br>
We can rush your order by printing out 100ct color prints on a high quality color laser printer this is only done for people who are waiting on a print job from the press department. it is an additional charge of 80.00 but its worth it if you need it now.<br><br>
<b>What software do you use?</b>
<br>
We use Adobe Pressready and Adobe Photoshop. If you have photos or files try to give them to us in an Adobe or Macromedia file format.</font>

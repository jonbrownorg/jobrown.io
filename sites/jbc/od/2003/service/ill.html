<font size=2><b>About Illustrations</b>
<br>
Illustrations arent just for books anymore. If your looking for a high quality graphic for a sign or letterhead then a quality hand drawn or computer rendered illustration may be just what you need. Most of the illustrations we provide are created with Adobe Illustrator, this program creates high quality vector illustrations that are re-sizeable up to the dimensions of a billboard and reducible down to a business card. An illustration is something that will enhance your corporate presence both online and off.

<b>Hand Drawn Illustrations</b>
<br>
We do also specialize in hand drawn illustrations. Both in color and in black and white we create these totally through pen and ink with watercolor enhancements. We can scan the final illustration for you or you can purchase the original illustration directly on paper. Once you pay for it, it becomes your property and not ours.<br><br>
<b>Vector Illustrations</b>
<br>
In addition to vector illustrations we also create custom clip art. Tired of having the same old clip art collection well let us create a custom set of clip art totally focused around your company and corporate identity.<br><br>
<b>What software do you use?</b>
<br>
We use Macromedia Freehand and Adobe Illustrator, if you have files that we can use then please save them in one of these formats.</font>

I served as Jon&#146;s academic advisor while he was a student here and had the pleasure of his presence in a number of my classes. I was able to observe his work and energy, and particularly to see the care and professionalism he applied to every assignment. In his work, Jon displayed a high level of creativity and always put a lot of effort into making his solutions to problems have a professional look. Additionally, Jon worked as the Manager of our Macintosh Computer Lab and did an exceptional job of supervising all student workers and maintaining good operating conditions of all equipment.  </font>

Jon was also instrumental in the reviving of Franklin Pierce University&#146;s Graphic Design Club, an organization which provided opportunities for our students to participate in practical assignments for a variety of clients. Under his leadership, the Graphic Design Club became one of the most successful organizations on campus.</font>

Jon&#146;s excellent work in his courses as a Graphic Communications major at Franklin Pierce earned him a degree with honors. I can highly recommend him without hesitation for any position requiring creativity, professionalism, and a strong sense of responsibility and initiative. If you have any questions or if I can add any further support, please don&#146;t hesitate to contact me.</font>

I have been Jons personnel officer for in Mongolia.  I helped train Jon at the beginning of the year and kept in frequent touch with him throughout the year, twice visiting him at his site.
<br><br>
Jon came into the year with college teaching experience but no TESL experience.  However, he was quick to pick up ideas and methods for teaching English during training and later to put them into practice.   </font>

Although I did not see Jon teach in the classroom, I did see him interact with his students and saw the effect of his teaching by talking to his students directly.  I was very impressed at how Jon was continually trying to help his students grow in their English level.  Even while walking down the street with his students, or when visiting their homes, he was constantly speaking at the appropriate English level with them in order to give them practice.
 <br><br>
The fruit of all Jons diligence showed.  I have rarely seen students learn English as quickly as I observed in Jons students.  Because of all the time Jon spent speaking with them, his students were comfortable speaking with me.

Jon struggled with cultural adjustments in the first semester, but in the second semester that was all finished.  I think that what he learned about relating cross-culturally in Mongolia will help him in Japan.
 <br><br>
I recommend Jon for a teaching position in Korea.  From what I have observed he will be a diligent, faithful, caring teacher.

Jon was instrumental in establishing a new program in digital media/animation in the fall 2001. He was able to take an idea for a program and make it viable. The program has since grown and stabilized from those early foundational days. </font>

Jon managed to successfully teach his classes, even though there were important technology problems with bringing a new computer (Mac) lab online. Again to his credit, he assisted our Technical Support Services Department by providing training to their staff and assisted with maintaining a new (to our campus) technology platform. His efforts to keep the Digital Media Lab operational were important to the continuity of other courses taught in the same lab.</font>

He assisted with organizing student lab monitors, providing open lab hours for students to work on their projects. He attended professional conferences enhancing his educational background, which in turn increased the academic level in the classroom. It was through his conference attendance that curriculum improvements evolved.</font>

Jon took the opportunity to expand his educational experience by teaching abroad. I believe that step indicates his desire and ability to adapt and change, to accept challenges in order to grow as a person and as an educator.</font>

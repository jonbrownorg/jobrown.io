Jon worked with us during as part of his college internship capstone class. He spent three months working with us at the main branch working on several critical designs and layouts. He worked closely with the other designers and photographers and always gave his creative insight on projects. 
<br><br>
While he was here we were working on the Orvis catalog layout. Jon was helpful in aiding photographers take stock photos of catalog items and then scanning and importing them into the catalog for layout. He surprised us all with his proficiency in Quark Xpress and his knowledge of Photoshop. He really did a great job and even helped us work out several of our Computer issues that we were having at the time. He also helped us work out several design ideas for invitations and cards while he was here.

The one thing I remember the most is that Jon was never late for work and he always put in late hours to make sure that the design looked good. He worked on and off location for photo shoots, aiding in helping photographers get the best exposure by using the light meter and setting up photography equipment. We were really pleased with the effort and his upbeat attitude.

Let me end by saying this, Jon is a really great guy and a wonderful employee. He will be a great addition to any design firm or studio. He offers more than just a designer skill level; he is so proficient with Apple computers that he will be invaluable in working and troubleshooting. Please accept this recommendation with the highest regard.

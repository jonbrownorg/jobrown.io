Jon Brown worked in our Kennebunk offices as a graphic designer in the classified ads section of the newspaper. It was in this role that we saw some amazing work done by him. 
<br><br>
He came to us as a part time employee and worked diligently to create effective and comprehensive page layout ad design ideas for several large and small businesses all over the state. He used his extensive knowledge of Adobe Photoshop, and Illustrator to bring a new level of creativity and design to the newspaper. He effectively worked with the sales department to help boost ad sales in our region and worked with the editorial staff with photo retouching and other graphic design tasks. He really showed us all what kind of designer we needed for our business.

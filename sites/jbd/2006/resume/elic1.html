Please accept my recommendation for Mr. Jon Brown as an English teacher among TEFL students.  I worked with Jon in our training time as he and other new teachers prepared for teaching the 2002-2003 academic year.  </font>

Jon did a fine job all throughout training.  I noticed that he always gave more than expected.  He stayed up very late creating communicative activities that would help his students more easily understand the concepts for each lesson he taught.  He also prepared clever computer generated teaching materials.  The students were eager to participate in his classes, and he showed genuine care for them as he taught, always trying to help them assimilate new grammar points.

At mid-year, when Jon passed through the capital from his rural teaching site, I was amazed that he had created a booklet of all his personal lesson plans, detailing the methods and ideas he had used from teaching the New Interchange series.  Jon knew that in future years he would be able to use the materials again, so he took the time to organize them.  This showed me the special kind of young man he is.  I believe you will find Jon a great asset to your program, and I wholeheartedly recommend him to you.

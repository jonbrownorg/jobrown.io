I am writing to you today to extend the highest recommendation of Jon Brown to your company and that you will give his application your fullest consideration. 
<br><br>
I had the pleasure of working with Jon not only as a fellow Graphic Communications major at Franklin Pierce University but also as a joint member of the college&#146;s Graphic Design Club, a club founded and operated by Graphic Communications students with the goal of offering free graphic design, promotional and marketing services to fellow student clubs, faculty and sporting/fund-raising events. Such promotional pieces and marketing tools produced by the club included full-color posters, brochures and promotional products such as t-shirts, key tags and bumper stickers. </font>

While serving as President of the club during the 1998-1999 academic year, I found Jon&#146;s participation in the club to be nothing but exceptional. He consistently attended every weekly meeting and was actively involved in meeting discussions about the club&#146;s direction and involvement in upcoming FPC events to help extend our services to the school as well as marketing the club&#146;s brand name. He would always accept new projects that were distributed by myself from our clients and with his extensive technical expertise with such applications as Quark Xpress, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop and various web technologies not to mention his outgoing personality in pleasing our clients, Jon was and still is a very valuable asset to any creative team.</font>

In closing, I would just like to give Jon Brown my highest endorsement and I strongly recommend and hope that his technical knowledge, his visionary &#147; Think Outside The Box &#148 mentality and constant ambition will soon become a new addition to your company. Thank you for your time and patience.</font>

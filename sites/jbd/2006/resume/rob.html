Jon Brown was my student in a number of classes while an undergraduate at Franklin Pierce University, 1997 - 2001. He was one of our best students. As an active learner, he worked well on his own, but if he came to a difficulty, unable to work it out on his own, he would ask questions. He was a good listener and always open to possibilities and suggestions from the teacher and from other students during in-class critiques and discussions. After listening he made his decision and followed it through while paying attention to be able to respond to influences as the project worked itself out. </font>

In class critiques and discussions he took an active role. His comments during these were helpful to the other students. He was always willing to help other students with a procedure that he was familiar with that others were not. Indeed as president of the Graphic Design Club he instituted a series of workshops on various computer soft wares to help students, particularly new students, become familiar with the software on our computers more quickly.</font>

His relaxed, easy-going manner sometimes hides the fact that Jon is intelligent, talented, and motivated. As a graduating senior he received the Graphic Communication Award. This award is given each year to a good student who has been particularly helpful around and of service to the Graphic Communications department through the four years she or he was a student. That describes Jon perfectly. He was always willing to help professors or other students. In addition to being attentive and responsive Jon is friendly and has a delightfully dry sense of humor. Needless to say, I recommend Jon to you very highly and hope you will give his application your fullest consideration.</font>

Jon did a fine job all throughout training.  I noticed that he always gave more than expected.  He stayed up very late creating communicative activities that would help his students more easily understand the concepts for each lesson he taught.  <a href="http://www.jonbrown.org/resume/elic1.html" target="myspot">More ...</a></font>

t was a sense of fate I believe that has brought him into our school as he never applied to our school directly. It is our practice here at the school to hire our teachers through a recruiter and <a href="http://www.jonbrown.org/resume/wonder2.html" target="myspot">More ...</a></font>

			<div class="col-md-6">
				<h2>Q: Where does this data come from?</h2><p class="nolight font-18">The data comes from Food & Water Watch, a reputable food and water safety advocacy organization in Washington DC. They routinely come out with recommendations on fish safety including which fish are safe to eat, which ones are sustainable and more. This app hopes to capture the essence of their hard work.</p> 
				<h2>Q: How do I view the fish data in each category?</h2><p class="nolight font-18">Fish data is segmented into six categories on the main view. You simply tap on the category your interested in and it will return those fish. You can then drill into the fish items to get more information about the fish as well as recommendations and the ability to share with a friend. </p> 	
				<h2>Q: What is the dirty dozen?</h2><p class="nolight font-18">The species on this list get a big thumbs down for failing to meet two or more of our criteria for safer and more sustainable seafood. For instance, imported farmed shrimp is linked to potential contamination, environmentally problematic farming methods and negative socio-economic implications for coastal communities. Open-water farmed salmon is also raises concerns in each of these categories. Bluefin tuna, a wild-caught species, raises major red flags in two areas: the status of the stock is very low due to international overfishing and it is associated with high levels of mercury contamination.</p> 	
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<h2>Q: What Questions to Ask About Your Seafood?</h2><p class="nolight font-18">More than 100 types of fish and shellfish were evaluated to create the only guide assessing not only the health and environmental effects of eating certain seafood, but also the impacts on coastal and fishing communities. Our guide recommends safer, more sustainable options based on your personal tastes and priorities.</p> 	
				<h2>Q: How does this app help with my overall health?</h2><p class="nolight font-18">Seafood is one of the major foods linked to foodborne illness. And it’s not just things like bacteria that could make eating seafood a concern, but also the drugs or other chemicals used to produce some farmed fish. The growing share of imported seafood that we consume is of particular concern because much of it comes from industrial-scale fish farms. Less than 2 percent of seafood imports to the U.S. are inspected for contamination. And the crowded, unsanitary conditions on many industrial fish farms breed bacteria, viruses and parasites, forcing producers to use antibiotics and chemicals to prevent disease outbreaks.</p>

				<h2>Q: How do I make food lists?</h2><p class="nolight font-18">Making lists is easy, just press the + button on the bottom left hand corner and it will automatically generate a new list. To name the list just click once and it will enter edit mode. Type in the name for your new list. To remove a list just select the list you wish to delete and press the delete key.</p> 
				<h2>Q: How do I set my BMI and calorie goals?</h2><p class="nolight font-18">Going to the preferences for the program will bring you to the caloric goals and BMI calculator. Here is where you will enter your information and it will calculate a target caloric intake goal based on your goals. You can always override the suggested goal with your own if you like.</p> 
				<h2>Q: How do caloric goals work?</h2><p class="nolight font-18">After you set your goal, it will be measured by the total number of calories in each food list that you create to show you how close you are to your goal in terms of daily consumsion of calories, weekly, and monthly so you know where you are at all times as you track your overall progress.</p> 
			
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<h2>Q: How do I add items to my lists?</h2><p class="nolight font-18">To view all the food items choose the Food Library list in the left side menu. This will automatically show you all 45,000+ foods in the database. You can scroll down and add the foods you want by clicking on the food and dragging it into a list. If you cant find the food you want then search for it in the search field above. The built in search will narrow down the library based on your keyword.</p> 
				<h2>Q: How do I add a custom food?</h2><p class="nolight font-18">To add a custom food, click on the Add Food button on the top of the food library list and fill out the details. It will add a custom food to the User Food Library where you can edit and manage all custom food entries. From there you can add these items to your food list and track the nutrition info the same as any other food item.</p> 
				<h2>Q: What is the difference between the Free and Paid version?</h2><p class="nolight font-18">The only difference is the size of the provided food library. The free food library is the USDA food library the paid version shows a food library that is more comprehensive and includes fast food restaurants and weighs in at over 45,000+ foods in the database. We also offer support for anyone who has purchased the full version of the app.</p>

				<h3>The Gist</h3>
				<hr>
				<p>Jon Brown Designs will collect certain non-personally identify information about you as you use our sites. We may use this data to better understand our users. We can also publish this data, but the data will be about a large group of users, not individuals.</p>
				<p>We will also ask you to provide personal information, but you'll always be able to opt out. If you give us personal information, we won't do anything evil with it. We can also use cookies, but you can choose not to store these.</p>
				<p>That's the basic idea, but you must read through the entire Privacy Policy below and agree with all the details before you use any of our sites.</p>

				<br><br>
				<h3>Reuse</h3>
				<hr>
				<p>This document is based upon the <a href="http://automattic.com/privacy/">Automattic Privacy Policy</a> and is licensed under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/">Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike License 2.5</a>. Basically, this means you can use it verbatim or edited, but you must release new versions under the same license and you have to credit Automattic somewhere (like this!). Automattic is not connected with and does not sponsor or endorse Jon Brown Designs or its use of the work.</p>
				<p>Jon Brown Designs, Inc. ("Jon Brown Designs") makes available services include our web sites (www.imamac.guru and www.jonbrown.org), our blog, our API, and any other software, sites, and services offered by Jon Brown Designs in connection to any of those (taken together, the "Service"). It is Jon Brown Designs's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</p>

				<br><br>
				<h3>Questions</h3>
				<hr>
				<p>If you have question about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at jon@jonbrown.org</p>

				<br><br>
				<h3>Visitors</h3>
				<hr>
				<p>Like most website operators, Jon Brown Designs collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Jon Brown Designs's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Jon Brown Designs's visitors use its website. From time to time, Jon Brown Designs may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
				<p>Jon Brown Designs also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Jon Brown Designs does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below. We may also collect and use IP addresses to block users who violated our Terms of Service.</p>

				<br><br>
				<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
				<hr>
				<p>Certain visitors to Jon Brown Designs's websites choose to interact with Jon Brown Designs in ways that require Jon Brown Designs to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Jon Brown Designs gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. Jon Brown Designs collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Jon Brown Designs. Jon Brown Designs does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Service-related activities.</p>
				<p>Additionally, some interactions, such as posting a comment, may ask for optional personal information. For instance, when posting a comment, may provide a website that will be displayed along with a user's name when the comment is displayed. Supplying such personal information is completely optional and is only displayed for the benefit and the convenience of the user.</p>

				<br><br>
				<h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
				<hr>
				<p>Jon Brown Designs may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to the Service. For instance, Jon Brown Designs may monitor the most popular parts of the https://www.imamac.guru.

				<br><br>
				<h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
				<hr>
				<p>Jon Brown Designs discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Jon Brown Designs's behalf or to provide services available at Jon Brown Designs's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using the Service, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Jon Brown Designs will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Jon Brown Designs discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Jon Brown Designs believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Jon Brown Designs, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of the Service and have supplied your email address, Jon Brown Designs may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Jon Brown Designs and our products. We primarily use our website and blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Jon Brown Designs takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

<P>Among the many events and competitions at a Scottish festival, the Highland Athletics, or Heavy Events, rank among the greatest crowd pleasers. There are generally seven of these tests of strength and technique; they include the Stone Putt, the 56-Pound Throw, the 28-Pound Throw, the Hammer Throw (16 or 22 pounds), the dramatic Caber Toss, the Sheaf Toss, and the 56-Pound Toss.</P>
<P>&#9;Despite the emphasis on individual performance, the sense of camaraderie among the competitors makes the athletics enjoyable for all. First timers, as well as seasoned veterans, receive advice and encouragement from their fellow athletes.</P>

Sheepdog Demonstrations
<br>
by David Kennard
<br>
of Wellscroft Farm Chesham, New Hampshire
</b>
<HR>
<P>
David Kennard of Wellscroft Farm in Chesham, New Hampshire, has been raising, training, and selling Border Collies for over 20 years. He has pleased audiences throughout New England with his informative and entertaining dog herding demonstrations at county fairs, wool days, and numerous special events. He is known for his ability to work several dogs simultaneously as he puts such animals as sheep and ducks through their routine. He always takes time to explain to the audience how and why the dog is able to move the animals. He frequently will engage children from the audience to try to put the sheep in the pen without the assistance of a dog. This proves to be very amusing and further emphasizes how one dog can do quickly what it would take many people a longer time to do.</P>

Twenty years ago, Kennard first used his Border Collies to facilitate moving his flock of 200 sheep around his farm; he continues to work his dogs every day. It is a common sight in Chesham to see him and his dogs herding a group of sheep down a town road, en route to a new pasture. <a href="Kenn.html">Con't</a>

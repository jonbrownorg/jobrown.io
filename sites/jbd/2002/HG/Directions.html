Here are the Directions to Oak Park, Greenfield NH Heading from the East
<br>
<br>
<br>
1. Take 101 E. to Wilton, NH
<br>
<br>
2. Take 31 N. into Greenfield
<br>
<br>
3. You'll come down a hill into the center of Greenfield, past the Greenfield Inn B&B and
the library on you left. Rt. 31 merges with Rt. 136 S. The large, handsome Greenfield 
Meeting House will be on a small knoll on your right.
<br>
<br>
4. Continue going straight on Rt 136 S.; dont take the right turn (just past the meeting house)
 which would keep you on Rt. 31
<br>
<br>
5. Bear right at the fork (leave 136-follow the signs to Greenfield State Park). Oak Park
is just ahead on your left. Greenfield State Park is across the road on the right.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

of Rts. 101 and 202
<br>
<br>
3. Turn left onto 202 N. and follow that approx. 8 miles. You'll start up a hill with a passing lane in the northbound lane. At the crest of the hill is a flashing yellow light suspended over 202. Turn right at that light onto Forest Road.
<br>
<br>
4. Continue on Forest Road (through a covered bridge) 4 miles until you come to Oak Park, which will be on your right. If you go into the center of Greenfield, you've gone a bit too far.

<td width=55><b>F.A.Q:</b><br>
This is the Frequently Asked Questions section, here we take all questions from 
all walks of life, and apply them to everyone. We try to cover all questions asked
of everyone, not just of this site. But in general, there are so many people who dont
even know there own name, and that is really pathetic, So out of the goodness in
my own heart I decided to make this page as a service to those individuals. You know
who you are.

<tr>

<td width=55><br><b>Arent you a little to sarcastic?:</b><br> You obviously dont know 
me very well, Im not sarcastic. In fact if I am sarcastic, the problem usually is Im not sarcastic enough. Sure sarcasm is a way to dodge  quetions, and aviod sticky situations, but it can
also be used to insult people.</td>

<tr>
<td width=55><br><b>Your too offensive..</b><br>Offensive is such a big word to 
describe my personality. I prefer to think of myself as gifted. To be able to pick out 
the flaws and imperfections in almost every facet of life.</td>
<tr>

<td width=55><br><b>Is this a joke</b><br>Of course this is a joke. I only want
an employer that understand sarcasm and humor. Because that is the type of person
i am. I like to joke and have fun. But when work time hits, Ive got that coverd.</td>
